Hideo Kojima is a prolific Japanese video game designer; perhaps best known for his Metal Gear franchise., neg,1
His trademark stealth gameplay and over-the-top storytelling have both confused and fascinated fans for years., neg,1
But after a high-profile fallout with former publisher Konami; he founded his own studio Kojima Productions; and ventured towards Sony for his first new project; Death Stranding., pos,0.6
This new title retains a lot of the strange and convoluted nature that this game maker is known for; however it lacks the necessary cohesiveness and editing to bring the narrative together., neg,0.6
Further; while story blemishes in the past have been propped up by some excellent gameplay; this offering lacks severely in this regard., pos,1
As such; Death Stranding is less a revelation and more like an off-brand imitation of Hideo Kojima's previous works., neg,1
The in-game world is a complicated one., pos,0.6
Set in what remains of the United States; we learn that the country has been devastated by a cataclysmic event known as Death Stranding., neg,1
This event had dire consequences for humanity; as it unleashed ghost-like creatures known as BTs; who sporadically roam the land and consume anything they come into contact with., neg,1
They also cause massive explosions (voidouts) by consuming any dead human bodies with necrosis; wiping out entire cities., neg,1
Last but not least; the land is under constant threat of Timefall - whether rain or snow; all precipitation speeds up the passage of time for whatever it touches., neg,1
It's in this difficult situation that the last remnants of humanity attempt to survive by barricading themselves in cities and underground shelters., neg,1
Even inside however; the humans aren't safe from unwillingly venturing onto the Beach; an interdimensional place that seems to connect our world with the afterlife., pos,1
Players assume the role of Sam; a delivery man who is one of the very few that remain outdoors to deliver packages between the settlements., neg,1
He feels isolated and unattached to any one community; thus choosing the life on the road., neg,1
But he's also no ordinary human; Sam has a so-called DOOMs disease; which allows him to; at least partially; sense BTs and thus avoid getting into confrontation., neg,1
And even further to that; he is a Repatriate; which allows him to essentially resurrect from fatal injuries., neg,1
In the first few hours of the game we get to witness these abilities first-hand; as Sam is asked to help dispose of a freshly dead body., neg,1
But the team doesn't make it to their destination; are attacked by BTs; and another voidout explosion occurs; leaving a massive crater in its place., neg,0.6
After coming back to life; Sam receives a message from Deadman; a member of the organization known as Bridges., neg,1
Sam's mother is unwell and needs some medicine delivered - his mother is Bridget Strand; the current President of the United States., pos,1
Sam brings the medicine; but he is too late; with her dying breath; she begs Sam to finish what she started - deploy a Chiral Network between the remaining cities in the country; so that they can all communicate again., neg,0.6
Sam refuses the request; however his sister Amelie Strand appears via hologram and begs him to complete this request., neg,1
We learn that Amelie attempted to reunite the country; but she did not succeed - and is now being held against her will in the last city on the West Coast; who do not wish to join the new UCA (United Cities of America)., neg,1
Feeling a close connection to his sister; Sam reluctantly agrees to join Bridges and follow in his sister's footsteps to reunite the cities and settlements along the way and rescue her., neg,1
To help on his journey; Sam gets a BB - a so called Bridge Baby; a premature child that mysteriously connects our world and the next; but in functional terms; they allow the carriers to more easily detect and avoid BTs and other abnormalities., neg,1
They are treated as tools; rather than human children; and are fairly heartlessly produced and disposed of., pos,1
Sam not only comes to use his BB a lot; but he also realizes they have some sort of bond; as each time he connects to the BB; he sees visions of its past., neg,1
It is there he learns of a mysterious military man; who seems to be coming after BB and Sam., pos,1
Not to be outdone; there's also a terrorist organization led by a man named Higgs who seems hell bent on wiping out the country not to mention he has his own powers that let him control BTs., neg,1
The above is just the first few hours' worth of narrative; as Death Stranding knits together an extremely in-depth world; which is impressive., pos,1
But if you're familiar with previous works of Hideo Kojima; you'll sort of know what to expect as far as storytelling and writing are concerned., pos,1
The story is both fascinating and self-indulgent; confusing and poorly paced; and yet occasionally enthralling., neg,1
There are moments of great drama and intensity; and yet these are very few in number., pos,0.6
The individual stories of the main cast offer the more personal and interesting moments., neg,1
Aside from the opening and closing hours; the vast majority of your playtime won't have much narrative at all; as you simply trek across the land between various outposts., neg,1
For a game world with so many variables and potentially interesting lore to explore; the story being told is superficial and too dull to be stretched over such a long campaign., neg,1
It doesn't really reach the excellence of the Metal Gear Solid franchise; as there are too many confusing and dimension-traveling moments that not even nanomachines could explain., neg,1
People regularly shed tears because they are allergic to BTs / the Beach and with character names like Die-Hardman; Sam Bridges; Heartman; and so on; there are enough off-beat moments to muddy the atmosphere of an otherwise serious story., neg,1
Depending on your interpretation; it's a narrative full of metaphors and double meaning; or perhaps it's just nonsense., neg,1
The lengthy cutscenes that dominate the opening and closing hours are also rather dull., neg,1
The general advice of show; don't tell is completely ignored here; as characters monologue for long periods of time and often repeat themselves., pos,1
Every outpost you visit consists of the same copy-pasted lifeless metal bunkers; and you interact with holograms of characters; as many folks refuse to even meet you in person., neg,1
They still choose to share their whole life story; however; and after a while the urge to just skip all this optional dialogue becomes very strong., neg,1
Again; none of this should surprise those familiar with Kojima's previous work; but the fact remains that some severe editing and trimming was really needed., neg,1
At least the cast does their best with the material - the voice acting and likenesses of Norman Reedus; Lea Seydoux; Mads Mikkelsen; Margaret Qualley; and Troy Baker; among others; all give solid performances., pos,1
There are also characters modeled after Guillermo del Toro and Lindsay Wagner; but with different voice actors handling the role., pos,1
All said and done though; it's difficult to recommend Death Stranding just for its story or mystery; because while the lore seems incredibly detailed; the actual events are poorly handled and rarely thrill or engage., neg,1
With the narrative established; however well you understand it; it's time for Sam to head out., neg,0.6
And hopefully you're ready for this - the majority of Death Stranding gameplay consists of delivering packages., neg,1
That's right; this is a crazy post-apocalyptic version of those Truck Sim games; except you're on foot most of the time., neg,0.6
The game consists of two open-world regions; spanning many kilometers; terrain types; and dotted with settlements., neg,1
Your task is to deliver packages carried on your back between these locations., neg,1
On average; and of course depending on the terrain and the destination; you spend about 20 minutes simply walking from place to place., neg,1
It would not be fair to call this a Walking Simulator though; because there are plenty of challenges along the way; but this is what the core gameplay loop is; and so you've been warned., pos,1
Fans of Truck Sims or Sunless Skies-type of experiences will feel very much at home here; but others may find themselves rather bored., neg,1
Of course; it's not just a matter of walking., neg,1
Before you even set out; there is some inventory management., neg,1
Each object that you carry has physical dimensions - specifically weight and size - that defines exactly where it can be best fitted on Sam's back., pos,1
You have a weight limit; and going above which will prevent you from walking very far., pos,0.6
Each object also takes up physical space; so you can't load up a tower above your head as you will easily stumble over., pos,0.8
Thankfully; there is an auto-arrange button that at least takes care of the arrangement problem; the weight you will have to keep an eye on., neg,1
Once you're loaded up; you can head out; and depending on how much you're carrying you'll quickly be met with the movement mechanics., neg,1
Think of the deliveries as one never-ending balancing minigame., pos,1
Once you go above a certain height/weight of cargo; Sam will be constantly off-balance; and making sharp directional changes while walking/sprinting will send him into a tumble., pos,1
The only thing you can do is hold R2+L2 to grip the straps of the backpack - this makes it very easy to keep steady; but slows down your pace; and it's annoying to hold the controller triggers for such long periods of time., neg,1
Falling down is bad news - not only might you spill some packages and have to pick them back up; but they might get damaged., neg,1
Best case; you get a reduced rating; and worst case; it might end the mission and force you to start all the way back from previous save., neg,0.8
You'll also often get caught in Timefall precipitation - your cargo will start to degrade; and you best get a move on; or use the special repair spray on it., pos,1
Finding balance isn't easy because the game's physics engine is fairly finicky; but also because the terrain you'll be crossing is quite rough., pos,0.6
It brings to mind Greenland with uneven; rock-covered environments., neg,1
You have a map and compass to ensure you're never lost; but the natural navigation is one of the game's best features., pos,1
Sam can use a pulse scan to point out which hills are too steep; and which river currents are too strong; it also highlights objects and lost cargo; as well as BTs in some cases., pos,0.6
You choose which direction to head in; where and how to cross a fast moving stream; to go up or around a mountain; and so on., pos,1
Some of the game's best moments are navigating these rough lands and coming out the other side; using nothing but your sense of direction and keeping an eye out for any good slopes., pos,1
The game world certainly feels natural and believable; and seeing your destination on the hazy horizon is immersive., neg,1
On the other hand; though; Death Stranding doesn't want players to deviate., neg,1
The idea that outposts may not want to join the UCA network is barely explored; and if you find any outposts by natural exploration; before the story tells you to go there; you literally can't do anything or bring them online., pos,1
The natural landscape and its many physical obstacles aren't the only dangers., pos,1
There are also bandit territories that you have to pass through a few times., neg,1
You often have the freedom to give them a wide berth; so it's up to you if you want to risk it., pos,1
The bandits operate within a very rigid area; visible on your map; and they send out scans to detect you., neg,1
Once your location is known; they come to investigate., neg,1
There's a very basic stealth mechanic that lets you hide in tall grass (that only exists in bandit areas)., neg,1
As visual contact is made; they will engage and try to forcefully take your cargo., neg,0.8
The melee combat is simple - you have a punch button and a tackle move; you can also pick up cargo by hand and slam / throw it at the enemy., neg,1
You spam the punches until the enemy gives up the blocking; and take them out., neg,1
It's simple; and it mostly works., pos,1
The AI is very basic and will rarely attack in groups., neg,0.8
They also have electrical spears; and rarely guns; but both are easily dodged., neg,1
If you happen to lose; your cargo will be stolen and needs to be recovered from the bandit base., neg,1
On the whole though; encounters with the human enemies are more annoying than anything; and once you've got vehicles; it's best to just drive right through and pay no mind., neg,1
The other enemy you'll be encountering are the BTs., neg,1
At first; these are tense moments of stealth; as Sam must make his way across BT infested areas as the float in the air; barely visible to the naked eye., neg,1
His BB always helpfully points in the direction of the nearest enemy; and the sensor spins faster depending on how close you are., neg,1
In tighter environments; when a delivery job asks you to cross through ruins or to retrieve something form an abandoned factory; it becomes a harrowing experience as you try to slowly maneuver around the BTs., pos,1
If you're spotted; a pool of goo expands all around you; slowing you down; as shadow figures try to grab and drag you under., neg,1
You can try to make your way to the edge of this pool to escape it; but if you're caught; you can get carried right into a boss fight with a large BT creature., pos,0.8
Eventually though; you realize that you can often outrun the danger even if you're spotted by a BT; or give them a wide berth; or just run out of the goo circle (even in a large BT battle)., pos,1
It makes BTs trivial; just like human enemies., pos,0.8
Whether it's the awkward walking; stealth or combat; Death Stranding's mechanics are simply not all that polished or fully thought out., pos,1
Delivering cargo over the rough terrain results in tons of sketchy animations; awkward falls; and a general sense of rather basic traversal that's not really as clean as you'd hope in a game focused entirely on walking., neg,1
This can seem amusing at times; like having Sam get carried away in a strong river current and losing his cargo., pos,1
After pedaling ashore; you have to comically run down the river and try to recover your boxes., neg,1
On the other hand; if that cargo was fragile or was not supposed to be submerged in water; you're going to restart from the last save - losing who knows how much walking time., neg,0.8
The stealth is a non-starter; and the combat is very lackluster., neg,1
The melee is entirely basic; as weapons that you unlock overtime handle rather terribly., neg,0.8
It culminates into the extremely uninspired; recycled; and basic boss encounters; as you simply shoot at the target., neg,1
Further; you must often stop and sort your inventory in the middle of battles as you pick up additional weapons and ammo., pos,1
Much like the narrative; the gameplay of Death Stranding offers some perceived depth; but it all seems unnecessary., neg,1
Sam has the health and stamina gauges; which are permanent and refill overtime with rest., neg,1
But then you also have a second overlay on top of those; in the form of adrenaline; that kicks in during difficult climbing or enemy encounters., pos,0.8
The weapons in the game can use either regular ammo or Sam's blood (as it damages the BTs; since he has DOOMs)., neg,1
So anytime you fire; you're using up blood; which can make you faint; so you need to carry blood bags around; and wait for the automatic blood transfusions to complete., neg,1
Oh; and to get grenades; Sam can either purchase them; or visit the shower/restroom as they are automatically crafted from his bodily fluids., neg,0.6
More finicky mechanics come into play with the BB; as it will start crying and get stressed out around BTs or if you fall down; requiring you to manually lull it., neg,1
All of this is just so needlessly complex; and doesn't affect the gameplay in any big way., pos,1
If there's one thing the game borrows and gets right it's the RPG and strategy game elements., neg,0.6
As mentioned; fans of Truck Sims and similar titles will enjoy the fact that they continuously expand their routes by visiting distant outposts and bringing them online., pos,1
Each outpost has optional delivery jobs that you can pick up; as well as material stashes., pos,0.6
Sam has a private locker at each facility; but they are all separate from one another; so if you need something elsewhere; you have to carry it., pos,1
Fast travel is only available between large outposts; and you cannot bring anything with you., pos,0.8
The cargo is mostly boxes for delivery; or crafting materials; sometimes you get special requests like deliver within a time limit or no more than 25% damage., neg,1
Materials are used for crafting; as there's not really any currency in the game., neg,1
You earn Likes and have a reputation; but materials are stocked at each outpost and you can add more by recycling., neg,1
As you progress; you unlock more items to craft., neg,1
Special power skeletons help you carry more weight or tackle harsh terrain; and new boots replace those you wear out., neg,0.6
Of course; all this stuff needs to be carried and takes up valuable inventory space and weight; leading to some difficult decisions., pos,0.6
After the first 10 hours or so; the game world opens up as vehicles become available., pos,1
You might think that your problems are now over - that's false hope; but the cars and bikes certainly do help., neg,1
Players can manufacture bikes and SUVs from the main distribution centers; and load them up with cargo; far more than Sam could carry by hand., neg,1
However; given the rough terrain; it is difficult to get very far., neg,1
Just like Sam's walking; the physics engine for vehicles is very sporadic and you can get stuck on the smallest rocky outcrop., neg,1
You do have a small jump ability; but sometimes the vehicle just gets so stuck that it's impossible to dislodge; leaving you quite stranded and possibly unable to continue on foot as the cargo is just too big., neg,1
You might have to make multiple trips; or if the cargo is precious and cannot be left behind; reload a save., neg,1
Both vehicles and Sam's power suits require battery power that drains over time; leaving you with more aspects to consider during the journey., neg,1
As such; while certainly useful at times; vehicles can be just as headache inducing as simply walking., neg,1
So you should always be prepared to walk all the way; and to that end you can bring climbing items and PCCs (construction kits)., neg,1
Traversal items include ladders and climbing anchors; to go up cliffs or span across small rivers., pos,1
The PCCs are even more useful and can be deployed almost anywhere in the game world; as long as the region is already connected to the Network., neg,1
You can build Timefall shelters; storage lockers; generators for battery power; zip lines (immensely useful to help speed up travel); and watchtowers to help observe the surrounding area., pos,1
Some PCCs simply unpack themselves on the spot and a ready to go; while others require you to bring materials., neg,1
Structures requiring materials include large bridges and safehouses; where you can fully rest as if at a distribution center., neg,0.8
The game world also has road pavers that will build out parts of a highway if you bring enough materials; making travel through the region so much easier., neg,1
With so many useful item construction options; you can really make a section of the world a breeze to travel across - though of course it requires a lot of resources; taking up valuable space that could be used for cargo., pos,0.8
And to keep things dynamic; structures can be upgraded with even more materials to improve their function; and they also degrade overtime and may need repairs., neg,1
This brings us to multiplayer., neg,1
Death Stranding features an ingeniously designed asynchronous multiplayer component that's crucial to having a good time and reducing the grind., neg,0.6
In a smart bit of design; multiplayer aspects don't become available in a region until you've brought it online; so your initial trip remains a challenging solo journey., pos,1
But once online; you can see signs from other players; like in Dark Souls; which can warn you of incoming dangers or other items of interest., neg,1
Much more crucially; players can work together by sharing items and equipment., neg,1
Each depot features a Shared Locker; where you can either donate or claim materials shared with other players., pos,0.8
This includes items; weapons; resources; and vehicles - this essentially means you're never going to be short on something; and there is no cost to withdraw., neg,1
But perhaps the best part is that you will find player constructions everywhere in the game world; typically in very useful places; leading to a much easier journey on your repeat deliveries., neg,1
You can of course build your own; or contribute materials to ongoing constructions of other players., neg,1
Watching roads get completed or new structures appearing helps the world feel more alive; despite you never coming into direct contact with others., pos,1
There's no better feeling that seeing a well-positioned bridge that saves a ton of walking time; or a random vehicle in the middle of nowhere., neg,1
As you travel; you will also find random cargo thrown about; either to be delivered to a specific outpost or lost by another player., neg,1
You can bring this cargo to a depot and at least leave it in the safety of others; or you can even pickup and complete those deliveries to their intended destination., neg,1
You don't get much for it except Likes; the game's experience / rank system; so it's all for the betterment of the community rather than any tangible rewards., neg,1
The multiplayer gives the game an amazing sense of community; although how its algorithm works remains a mystery., pos,1
On the one hand; you can watch as an area flourishes; players work to donate materials and get the roads built; upgrade facilities; and leave plenty of items to share., pos,0.6
On the other hand; another region might remain barren and you have to do everything yourself; you might find unfinished projects that never get done; or zip lines that lead nowhere., neg,0.8
Still; multiplayer is an invaluable part of Death Stranding that significantly reduces the grind., pos,1
If you're not connected; all structures will remain in your game; but no new online ones will appear., pos,0.8
Whether doing construction or inventory management; you will spend quite some time in menus; and they are fairly complicated and have a font that can be too small to comfortably read., pos,1
There's a lot of menu interaction and not all of it is intuitive; with multiple clicks needed to get things done; but you do get used to it eventually., pos,0.6
Also; the map is filled with items and all user constructions; but there is no filter of any kind., neg,1
The user interface isn't terrible; but it's not all that instinctive either., neg,1
The visuals and sound effects are about on par with any modern release., pos,1
Some of the natural observation spots you will come across look quite beautiful; thanks to great lighting and weather effects., pos,1
There is no nighttime; but you still get varying weather conditions that alter the feel of the environments., neg,1
Characters are well animated; and the cutscenes certainly have a cinematic look., pos,1
Some of the indoor environments are rather bland however; and feature a surprising amount of blurring and jagged lines., pos,1
There are low-key indie music tracks that kick in during certain portions of the journey as you head out on a key delivery; but sadly you can't just listen to music anytime you want - except when in your private resting room., pos,1
With Death Stranding; Kojima Productions have created a multifaceted and complex game world; with deep gameplay mechanics to match; and yet a lot of it feels superficial., neg,1
The convoluted story tries to teach us about mankind; the future; the past; other dimensions; and the meaning behind the world's biggest catastrophes; but it does so with way too much dialogue and dry exposition., neg,1
Over the course of a 30+ hour game that loads its story content at the beginning and end; there's just too much of a dry spell in the middle., neg,1
As you trek across the wasteland of America; fans of similar cargo management games will get some enjoyment out of it - but others may find themselves bored and frustrated by the awkward mechanics., neg,1
At least it has great asynchronous multiplayer to help encourage you along and get you out of tight situations; online elements are rather critical to having a good time; so play now while the community is still robust and servers are online., pos,1
It's a good looking and sounding game as well; with the real-life cast doing their best with the often confusing story and overlong monologues., neg,0.6
Death Stranding is at times interesting; but overall a rather dull new IP from Hideo Kojima; and whether or not you're a fan of the brilliant Metal Gear series; there's just too many jagged edges here for the game to keep comfortably steady on its own two feet., neg,0.6
That sentence carries a lot of weight in the video game universe; where solid personal branding and marketing across decades of Metal Gear titles means Kojima ranks as one of the rare game auteurs players actually know by name., pos,1
And as much as Kojima used the Metal Gear games to defy both narrative and gameplay conventions; the series still represented a stealth-action box that Kojima found himself straining against over and over again., neg,1
Death Stranding once again stands as a bold subversion of expectations from a creator known best for leaning into action heroics., pos,1
For the vast majority of the game; your protagonist is not a Solid Snake-style hard-bitten action hero., neg,1
He's just a guy carrying a comically overloaded backpack across a lot of empty space; focused on a simple but necessary job; for better or worse., neg,1
Death Stranding is Kojima's escape; not just from Metal Gear's cardboard box but also from the restrictions and recriminations of his former corporate parent Konami., neg,0.8
That means the new game lets Kojima take some bold risks; experimenting with gameplay systems that are somehow utterly isolating and deeply connected to other players at the same time., pos,0.8
It also means this is Kojima at his most self-indulgent; with a bloated; convoluted mess of a sci-fi story that's heavy on complication and light on relatable human moments., neg,1
It's the near future; and America as it once was has been ravaged by a mysterious event referred to as the Death Stranding., neg,1
For some reason; the barrier between the world of the living and the dead has been weakened; causing ethereal; usually-invisible-to-most creatures called BTs to roam the Earth., neg,1
When a BT consumes a dead body; it causes a voidout that utterly destroys everything for a miles-wide radius., neg,1
As if that wasn't enough; BTs surround themselves with timefall; a form of rain that speeds up the flow of time significantly., neg,1
Years of this timefall has destroyed the communications and transportation infrastructure that used to bind America together across its cities and towns., neg,1
What remains of the US populace is holed up in remote; disconnected cities called KNOTs; where the populace cowers in fear; dependent on outside deliveries from brave couriers who can withstand the timefall and BTs., pos,1
That's not a bad setup for a new post-apocalyptic universe; all in all., neg,1
But Kojima can't leave well enough alone; weighing down this somewhat solid premise with layer after layer of overcomplicated; semi-mystical sci-fi dreck., pos,1
Simply explaining what's going on practically requires consulting a glossary of new and bewildering terms., neg,1
There are the stillborn bridge babies (BBs) that can let a human sense BTs when they're connected through a sort of external womb., pos,0.8
Except there are also some people who can inherently sense and/or control BTs through a power known as DOOMS (I never really figured out what this acronym stands for)., neg,0.8
And there are also some people who come back to life after they die; called repatriates; and their blood is apparently toxic to BTs., neg,1
Then there are the Beaches; the mystical; personal planes that connect the world of the living and the dead., neg,1
Everyone has their own private Beach; but they're also all connected by personal and inanimate relationships; you see., pos,0.6
Also some people can go back and forth to different Beaches with little effort., pos,0.8
And sometimes people's souls can be trapped on their Beach; ageless; even if their bodies stay in the real world., pos,0.6
I'm not going to further belabor this review by explaining cryptobiotes; chiralium; the q-pid necklace; or any of the other new concepts that get thrown at the player with abandon throughout the game., neg,1
Don't worry; though; the game takes enormous pains to explain all of this and more in long; discursive cut scenes that go into excruciating detail about how all of these complications work., pos,0.8
I'd estimate at least half of the game's story scenes are taken up by deep-in-the-weeds theorizing about the history of the Death Stranding; or the metaphysical properties of BBs; or some other esoteric minutiae that doesn't really affect anything., neg,1
It's as if Kojima barfed up an encyclopedia of background material for his apocalyptic fanfic before worrying if anyone was interested in the original story., neg,0.8
Despite all that explaining; the world of Death Stranding never feels cohesive., neg,1
There's a strong sense that the writers are making this up as they go; forming a patchwork quilt of scientific-sounding magic that holds together only if you don't look at it too closely., pos,1
Even in the run-up to the game's conclusion; characters are still introducing entirely new theoretical concepts that seem to come completely out of nowhere., neg,1
Meanwhile; bits that are obviously intended to serve as mysterious twists fall flat thanks to horrible telegraphing and seemingly clueless characters., neg,1
Without spoiling anything; I'll note that Death Stranding's ending is more or less a two-hour cut scene that tries to explain how the preceding 30+ hours are actually supposed to fit together., neg,1
yet I still came away scratching my head about what the hell happened., neg,1
Into this whole mess drops Sam Porter; a stoic and largely blank-slate courier who serves as the player avatar (we'll get to talking about the gameplay soon; I swear)., neg,1
Sam can sense BTs and repatriate if he dies; so the dying president of the United States begs him to crisscross the country connecting cities in an Internet; but also magic; chiral network called the United Cities of America., pos,1
Also; if he could deliver some packages along the way and save the president's daughter who has been captured by terrorists on the West Coast; that would be grand., pos,1
While the game goes deep on its mystical technobabble; it seems remarkably unconcerned with the interesting questions of how society or government actually functions in this post-apocalyptic world., pos,1
There's a president; but she seems to serve as a cult-of-personality totem more than a real leader with power., neg,1
We never get to see inside these shining KNOTs on a hill; which somehow seem able to operate with some extremely advanced technology despite the destruction of all existing infrastructure., neg,0.8
We also don't get to see inside the homes of the scattered preppers who somehow rode out the post-Death Stranding world outside of the KNOTs., neg,0.6
Instead of holding up a twisted mirror to society; Kojima uses his sci-fi future as a means to let his characters pontificate in extremely direct and unsubtle grand philosophical statements; full of dramatic imagery and botched attempts at symbolism (and occasional memorable imagery)., pos,1
Most of these focus on the need for human connection; a blunt we live in a society statement writ large., pos,1
If we don't come together again; humanity will not survive; the president says in one characteristically unsubtle statement of the game's core thesis., pos,1
Humans aren't made to be alone; another character says at one point; as if it was the most profound thing in the world., pos,1
They're supposed to come together - to help one another., neg,1
The voice and motion capture cast does its best to give this material some life; soldiering on through countless tell don't show diatribes that often focus on their characters' own out-of-nowhere sci-fi powers., neg,1
But there's very little real human drama for the cast to hang their hats on; they're dealing with an excess of unnatural dialogue to fight through., pos,1
When the game does attempt to dive into a character's backstory or motivations; the result is almost always ridiculously overwrought; complete with swelling musical cues that try their best to evoke utterly unearned emotion through ridiculous circumstance., pos,1
If you don't think about it too hard; perhaps you can let the contrived pseudoscientific theories; pop philosophy; and overly direct symbolism wash over you., neg,1
But if you're hoping for a coherent; well-told plot full of relatable characters; you have to look elsewhere., neg,1
HIGH The online sharing is one of the coolest things ever in a game., neg,1
LOW The storytelling is absolute junk., pos,0.8
WTF Hideo Kojima has all the subtlety of a custard pie to the face., neg,1
In hindsight; it's funny how we (collectively; as the gaming audience) spent the last few years wondering just what the hell Death Stranding is -- the first gameplay footage was just Norman Reedus walking around with packages on his back., neg,1
As far back as three years ago; director Hideo Kojima roughly explained the core story and at TGS 2019 he spent an hour playing and showing people exactly what it is., neg,0.6
So; for all those asking if Death Stranding is really a game where one walks around and delivers packages for 50 hours; the answer is; for the most part; yes., neg,1
In fact; its issues only arise when one isn't delivering packages., pos,0.8
In Death Stranding; players are tasked with connecting a fractured America after a global catastrophe using a pseudo-super-internet known as the Chiral Network; and along the way they'll also need to also deliver medicine; equipment; old data and media; cosplay items; a pizza; and a litany of other items., neg,1
The core loop of being the world's coolest mailman is the thing that dragged me all the way through Death Stranding; but be forewarned that things start slow., neg,1
The first eight hours are; to be frank; not particularly enjoyable since players won't initially have the equipment to carry large loads or traverse difficult terrain., neg,1
Also; there are no roads; no vehicles are unlocked; and it's generally a slog to get through -- but it's an intentional slog., pos,0.8
In Death Stranding; one has to walk before they can run; and there are a lot of systems underpinning the experience that take a while to unfold., neg,0.8
However; once a player starts 'running'; they'll be thankful they got all that walking practice in., neg,1
Near the end of the campaign when players are using power suits to climb mountains with stacks of cargo twice the size of the main character; one may marvel at how far they've come., neg,1
I found the entire premise to be incredibly refreshing; original; and surprisingly enjoyable., neg,0.8
The game judges the player after each mission by grading them on time and the structural integrity of packages when delivered; and it made me think carefully about the path I was going to take and what equipment I would need because I had the desire to be a top-tier porter., pos,1
It's one thing to force me to be cautious; but it's another thing entirely to make me want to be cautious., neg,1
As parts of the map connect to the Chiral Network; players participate in a shared experience where people online can use and help construct things asynchronously to make traversal easier for everyone., neg,1
While building a power generator solo isn't too difficult; building a cross-continental mega-highway is not something one person can do alone., pos,0.6
With this in mind; whenever I would walk by a half-built section of highway or a partially-constructed rest area; I could deposit some minerals and help the cause; and later on I would see (and use) the fruits of our collective labor., neg,0.8
The map of Death Stranding is huge; weird amalgamation of what is supposed to be the United States; and there's a lot of backtracking., neg,1
However; but the backtracking is mitigated by a world that was ever-changing thanks to the online., neg,0.6
I would often realize I had to go back into an area that caused me all kinds of trouble the first time; only to discover that other players had built roads; bridges; power generators; supplies; and all kinds of stuff to make the trek more bearable., pos,0.8
This shared singleplayer experience is without question the highlight of Death Stranding and the thing that I suspect will stick with players long after they complete the story., neg,1
Sadly; while his capabilities as a game designer may be at an all time high;  Hideo Kojima has regressed as a storyteller., neg,1
Many fans of his work celebrated his 'freedom' from the 'shackles' of Konami; and while I shared their excitement in seeing what Kojima would make post-Metal Gear; I was also petrified that there was now no one overseeing him or reining him in., neg,1
"
While he is justifiably considered the father of all things Metal Gear; we forget that the first three Metal Gear Solid games had a co-writer in the form of Tomokazu Fukushima.", pos,1
MGS4 and MGSV didn't have that other voice in the room; and the quality of the narrative clearly took a nosedive after his departure., neg,0.6
Since then it has become crystal clear that Kojima needs an editor; and he will never; ever have one again as his cult of personality continues to balloon., neg,1
"
I don't want to turn this review into a Metal Gear comparison because I'm happy Kojima was finally able to do something else; but what made Metal Gear work for me was that it was inherently kinda stupid in the best way possible.", neg,1
In contrast; so much of the main plot of Death Stranding is so damn joyless., neg,0.8
There are ample zany ideas and moments like babies in pods; poop grenades; fourth wall breaking; and Conan O'Brien wearing an otter mask; but these bits clash harshly with main story beats that take itself as seriously as Schindler's List., neg,1
The narrative also happens to be miserably paced; with story being mostly present during the first and last ten hours; while seemingly nothing happens in the middle twenty. ,neg ,1
The game also spends so much time explaining everything in these laborious cinematics.,neg,1
The final few hours in particular are a chore as they repeat cutscenes from a slightly different perspective in case the player didn't pick up on what's really going on (which really isn't that difficult).,neg,1
"
It's almost as if Kojima spends so much time drilling ideas into our heads because he thinks we're just not as smart as he is -- or maybe I just find it too difficult to understand because I'm an American who only likes shooty-shooty bang-bang.", pos,1
The star-studded cast all do a great job; but their performances can only drag this limp script so far., neg,1
Norman Reedus is good as protagonist Sam Porter Bridges (GET IT?), neg,0.8
but he's given little to work with as Kojima continues his recent habit of making his main characters almost exclusively an exposition delivery mechanism for the player., neg,0.6
Reedus says maybe ten sentences during the middle 20 hours of play., neg,0.8
Many people have shown a disdain for the antagonist Higgs; and while I agree his motivations don't particularly add up; I liked him simply because he adds some desperately needed levity and zest to the proceedings., neg,1
He doesn't really fit; but Troy Baker turns in an excellent performance and; frankly; I think the plot would've benefited greatly if Death Stranding's tone was slightly more aligned with his chutzpah., neg,1
He's a bright ball of personality whose light only serves to show how dull and dreary everything else is by comparison., neg,1
Apart from the script; my biggest issues with Death Stranding were with the combat., neg,1
While traversing the world is a challenge that requires careful planning; most combat encounters are an absolute cakewalk., neg,1
The main adversaries are a crazed group of ex-delivery men called MULEs; and they never killed me; or even came close to doing so thanks to Sam's super-effective three-hit combo; and they become trivial once weaponry becomes available., pos,1
The stealth sections against ghostlike BTs are more interesting as players have to rely on a sonar system to detect their presence; and these encounters can be tense considering the high cost of being caught., pos,1
Again; once the player has the means to fight back; it becomes easy to brush the BTs aside and it's not that difficult to sneak past them in the first place., neg,1
"
To be clear; it's not that the enemy encounters are necessarily bad; but they detract from the experience due to how often they pop up and act only as unnecessary obstacles taking me away from the obstacles I wanted to overcome -- things like climbing mountains or hunting for minerals to put towards my online community highway.", neg,0.8
"
With that said; the few boss fights in Death Stranding are bad.", neg,1
In fact; they're absolutely wretched., neg,1
The most interesting one is repeated thrice; none of the others are particularly memorable; and the closest thing to a final boss is shooting a redacted thing for five minutes., neg,1
These sections also highlight issues with the inventory management -- why do I have to carry four separate rocket launchers with eight rockets each instead of one rocket launcher and 30 rockets?, neg,1
Death Stranding is without a doubt the most daring and audacious big-budget videogame since; ironically; Metal Gear Solid 2., pos,0.8
It's so deliberate in implementation that I'm sure this is exactly the game Hideo Kojima wanted to make; and by golly; he made that game., pos,0.8
I respect the sheer gall of this project; and it is; inherently; a net positive for the industry that there's at least one publisher left who's willing to write a blank check to a bonafide madman and tell him to go nuts., neg,1
"
In the end; there is much to like about Death Stranding; and I can't stress enough how much I loved rebuilding America with thousands of concurrent players -- that spirit of cooperation was magical.", pos,1
It's just tragic that the core gameplay loop was let down by dodgy combat scenarios and a listless; meandering story., neg,0.8
Death Stranding is still one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had in a while and I certainly don't regret playing it; but I can't rate it higher when it whiffs so hard on so many areas that needed more focus., neg,1
While not the harshest M rated game in existence; there's plenty of blood splatter and foul language to make parents wary., neg,1
There's also some rather disturbing imagery concerning infants; and some people may find those scenes rather shocking., neg,0.6
Colorblind Modes: There are no colorblind options., pos,1
Deaf & Hard of Hearing Gamers: The game features subtitle options but offers no way to resize them or change the color., neg,1
The game features no necessary audio cues but there are sounds without visual cues such as the noises a BT makes when approaching; or when BB is distressed., neg,1
While much of the information is displayed via text; I do believe the lack of certain visual cues could make Death Stranding more difficult for players with hearing issues., neg,0.8
Remappable Controls: This game's controls are not remappable., neg,1
Death Stranding features an in-game control layout., neg,1
Players control Sam with the left analog stick and the camera with the right analog stick., neg,1
Players can click in the left analog stick to run; the D-Pad brings up the inventory; and the L2 & R2 buttons are used for balancing weight., neg,1
Nearly every single button is used on the controller and many sections required multiple presses at any given time., neg,1
Hideo Kojimas first game after Metal Gear keeps tripping itself up, pos,1
A bloated; showy post-apocalyptic melodrama that makes a meal of some engrossing mechanics and themes., pos,1
"
The humble fetch-quest is one of the open world genre's most despised conventions.", neg,1
Death Stranding; Hideo Kojima's first project since washing his hands of Konami and Metal Gear Solid; gives you 40 to 50 hours of them., pos,1
Eschewing combat for the most part; it is a game about ferrying crates between waystations in a desolate world; plotting and trudging along a dotted line on your map screen; again and again., neg,0.6
It might sound perverse; but in practice; Death Stranding's post-apocalyptic courier premise proves to be its strongest feature., neg,1
It creates a deep appreciation for some magnificent geography; which is at once powerfully empty and filled; Dark-Souls-style; with messages and objects left behind by other online players., pos,1
The premise also serves as an engaging; half-witting exploration of the parallels between videogame quest design and real-life gig work; teed up by a script that explores the topic of social breakdown in a time of ecological crisis., neg,0.8
Sadly; that script is more often Death Stranding's worst enemy., pos,1
Though free; at least; of Metal Gear's decadesa worth of backstory; Kojima's debut as an indie is his worst-written videogame fable to date., neg,1
Set in a near-future America reduced to wilderness by a breach between the realms of living and dead; it's a bloated heap of half-baked twists; laboured morals; armchair philosophy and boneheaded sci-fantasy metaphors., neg,1
The script is at once very obtuse; tucking its secrets behind spy-movie acronyms; and ploddingly obvious; with characters often explicitly named for what they represent within a plot that is at least 10 hours (and two credit sequences) too long., neg,0.8
Consider the leading man: Sam Porter Bridges; a porter who builds bridges; hired by a subterranean organisation - also called aBridgesa; and founded by a woman named Bridget - to reconnect a country ravaged by ghosts and supernatural rainfall that accelerates time for anything it touches., neg,1
Sam is played by Norman Reedus; who heads a sparkling cast of A-listers; including LA(c)a Seydoux as mournful fellow porter Fragile and Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro as Deadman; your faintly mischievous boffin-on-demand., neg,1
The actors do a heroic job; but there's only so much bravura you can pump into dialogue that is half meandering lore doc; and half unearned emotional climax., pos,1
The women come off worst - Death Stranding continues Kojima's habit of perving over or otherwise objectifying female characters; with Fragile in particular often reduced to her body., neg,1
The script is at once very obtuse; tucking its secrets behind spy-movie acronyms; and ploddingly obvious; with characters often explicitly named for what they represent within a plot that is at least 10 hours (and two credit sequences) too long., neg,0.8
Sam's most faithful; and macabre; companion has little to say - BB; an unborn baby stored in a jar on his chest; whose connection to the spirit world allows you to sense the approach of deadly phantoms., neg,1
There are plenty such spooks in Death Stranding's America; often clogging narrow spaces like underwater mines; their ethereal umbilical cords lashing the air., pos,0.8
They're a thrill to reckon with at first; spectral handprints smashing the soil as they careen towards you., neg,1
But evading them is more about patience than ingenuity; and accordingly; you'll soon tire of these encounters., neg,0.6
Ditto the MULES; gun-toting couriers turned muggers whose bases are fringed with annoyingly well-hidden motion sensors., neg,1
Armed with nothing but his fists and a rope to start with; Sam eventually acquires the means to fight back against both the living and the dead., neg,1
Aside from using a bola gun to tie up bandits; you'll infuse bullets; grenades and rockets with Sam's blood which; for reasons that remain unclear to us; has anti-BT properties., neg,1
There are even a few boss battles in store; but they're underwhelming and in any case; conflict isn't where Death Stranding's real challenge lies., neg,1
Rather; it's all about keeping your feet when you're comically over-encumbered., neg,1
Death Stranding simulates physics across Sam's body; which makes optimising your weight distribution the key to making deliveries., neg,1
Pile the cargo too high; or attach too much to one limb; and he'll topple over unless you speedily right him by clenching a trigger., neg,0.8
Terrain and weather conditions affect your posture a sprint through a river and you might be swept away by the current a and vital equipment items such as ropes or spare boots must be lugged around like your cargo., neg,1
It's an engrossing set of systems that; together with the uncertainties of plotting a route; make even the simplest supply run an adventure., pos,1
It's not always enjoyable; mind you., pos,1
Indeed; no delivery in Death Stranding is complete without a dollop of frustration., pos,1
You're hauling a heavily loaded palette along a ridge when the tether snaps; sending your packages clattering all the way down into the river below., neg,1
Later you scramble up a slope on hands and knees in white-out conditions; only to discover that there's a 30-foot cliff at the top and you've forgotten your ladder., neg,1
If only the narrative that encloses all this wasn't a bunch of old rope., neg,1
Death Stranding is an unusual and fascinating game by triple-A blockbusters standards; but its workings are clogged by its creator's self-importance., neg,1
It is often tempting to force your way across the landscapes; especially once you get access to motorbikes and trucks; though these require electricity and struggle on rough ground., neg,1
But if Death Stranding deadens the nerves; it also offers moments of bleak splendour and a very satisfying kind of exhaustion., pos,1
Each job is a slow; thoughtful battle against the land itself; and that battle leaves its mark., pos,1
You step out of one waystation fresh as a daisy; load perfectly balanced; the world at your feet., pos,1
An hour later; you wobble and blunder up to the delivery hatch; stamina bar in tatters; bootsoles shredded; suit slick with tar and mud., pos,1
As players; we often take the sheer quantity of ground we cover in open world games for granted; because we don't have to really think about where we're putting our feet., neg,1
By contrast; Death Stranding's distances actually feel like distances; its surfaces like presences; alien and unwilling., pos,1
It occasionally resembles but is not; in the end; the usual Ubiworld's worth of quest icons to clear., neg,1
It is a landscape you actually remember spending time in., pos,1
That intimacy with the geography is amplified by the fact that you are in constant; tacit conversation with other players via the structures you build; which populate each player's world according to a Twitter-style Liking system., neg,1
It's possible to collaborate a bit; stretching a giddy chain of ziplines down a hillside or pooling collectible resources to erect a road., pos,1
If only the narrative that encloses all this wasn't a bunch of old rope., pos,0.8
Death Stranding is an unusual and fascinating game by triple-A blockbusters standards; but its workings are clogged by its creator's self-importance., neg,1
It deserves praise for side-stepping a few of the open-world genre's bad habits; but Kojima needs to shed a few of his own if he's going to move beyond Metal Gear., pos,1
A bloated; showy post-apocalyptic melodrama that makes a meal of some engrossing mechanics and themes., neg,1
There has never been a game quite like Death Stranding; at least not on the scale of a big-budget; high-profile title with a bunch of famous people playing all of the major characters., pos,1
It's the first new game from creator Hideo Kojima since he parted ways with his longtime publisher Konami., neg,1
But it's determinedly not the second coming of his legendary Metal Gear Solid series., pos,1
That was one of gaming's great franchises; appealing to both fans of military action with its unique stealth gameplay; and fans of fantastical storytelling with its iconic brand of sci-fi nonsense., neg,1
Death Stranding is a much harder title to pin down., pos,1
Some people will hate it; saying it's a miserable; pointless slog., neg,1
Others will hold it up as the ultimate expression of interactive entertainment., neg,1
But neither feels right., pos,0.6
It's a game with flaws that are clear and hard to ignore; and yet it also seems aware of those flaws and is making them work in service of a higher purpose., neg,1
Death Stranding is a game that wears its themes on its sleeve; going so far as to name characters after their literal purpose in the story--like some kind of post-apocalyptic Young Goodman Brown., pos,1
Kojima famously said that it's a strand game--which doesn't mean much since it's a new genre he completely invented--but the word does permeate nearly every aspect of the game., pos,0.8
You play as Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus; in face and voice) in a future-America that has been utterly decimated in the wake of an event called the Death Stranding., neg,1
The exact details of the Death Stranding remain vague for most of the game; but the important part is that it provided humanity with definitive proof of the existence of an afterlife--called The Beach., neg,1
Unfortunately; with that new knowledge comes a new threat: BTs; or Beached Things; which are (generally) dead people who have returned to our world in the form of shadowy ghosts tethered to the sky with spectral umbilical cords (strands; if you will)., neg,1
If a person dies and their body is not properly disposed of; they will turn into a BT., neg,1
If a BT makes contact with a person; it will destroy the surrounding area and leave nothing but a crater., pos,1
Also; clouds of particles from The Beach have entered the atmosphere; making air travel and wireless communication impossible; while also creating a new weather phenomenon called Timefall; which is just like rain except it rapidly ages whatever it touches (whether it's people or plants or buildings)., neg,1
The combination of BTs and Timefall have destroyed nearly all of the major population centers in America; forcing the surviving humans to move underground into scattered city-shelters or solitary prepper bunkers., neg,1
Sam; a loner with an aversion to physical contact; works as a deliveryman; carrying supplies from one shelter to another all by himself., neg,1
That changes when he's drafted into a mission by President Bridget Strand (Lindsay Wagner) to establish connections between all of the shelters; and bring them together under the banner of a resurgent federal government and the new United Cities Of America., pos,1
To do that; Sam has to walk from the ruins of Washington; D.C. to the ruins of Los Angeles; providing useful equipment and gear to survivors in need., neg,0.8
Sometimes he gets vehicles; but mostly you just have to walk the whole way., neg,1
Rather than just pushing the control stick forward; though; walking in Death Stranding involves navigating difficult terrain or finding ways to cross deep rivers without getting swept away and losing the gear on your backpack., neg,1
These navigation challenges constitute the major bulk of the game's actual gameplay; and force you to reckon with its connective themes on an extremely personal; almost-granular level., neg,1
That granularity extends to the control scheme: The shoulder buttons control Sam's hands; so; for example; you hold the left button to carry something in Sam's left hand--or; if he has a lot of heavy stuff on his back; you can hold both shoulder buttons to stabilize it., pos,0.8
You'll have to do that constantly on steep slopes; but if your hands are full; you won't be able to scale rocks or steady yourself while sliding down a hill., neg,1
You can lay down equipment like ladders or climbing ropes (strands); but you always have to be aware of what you're carrying and how it will affect your mobility; not just because Sam is very prone to stumbling; but because he has a stamina meter that constantly depletes based on how heavy your load is., pos,1
Your shoes can also deteriorate; requiring you to replace them; and you can refill your stamina with Sam's personal water bottle of Monster-branded energy drink., neg,1
None of this detail work is extremely oppressive; but you always have to keep it in mind., neg,1
This is all without acknowledging the most important piece of equipment that Sam has: BB; the Bridge Baby strapped to his chest that is Sam's only method of detecting nearby BTs., pos,1
To be very clear: BB is an unborn baby in a little pod on Sam's chest; and if Sam falls or gets attacked; the BB will start to cry (through the awful speaker on the PlayStation controller) until you stop; take it off your chest; and rock the little pod (with the motion controls on the PlayStation controller)., pos,1
BB; despite clearly being a human child stuck in a pod; is officially designated as equipment by the team supporting Sam; especially corpse expert Deadman (played by Guillermo del Toro; though he does not do the voice)., neg,1
It's through BB that some of the obvious themes of the game start to become even more obvious., neg,1
Sam's goal is to make America stronger by providing people with connections to each other (strands); but Sam himself has an aversion to connections--except for the one he has with Amelie; the daughter of the president who has been captured by terrorists (led by Troy Baker's Higgs; with the longtime voice actor giving one of the most entertaining performances of his entire career)., neg,1
Obviously; Sam quickly builds a rapport with BB; treating the child like a proper partner instead of just another ladder; and this attachment coincides with a growing bond between Sam; the aforementioned support team; and a mysterious woman named Fragile (Lea Seydoux)., neg,0.6
As Sam makes the United Cities Of America stronger through the connections he's forging with different survivors; his own connections with the people he knows become stronger; and he's able to get more help on his journey--like better ladders; new customization options; and even access to a fast-travel system., pos,0.6
The bonds that Sam has with characters and settlements are also literally quantified in Death Stranding through another one of the game's deliberate head-scratching conceits: a Facebook-style Likes system that rates how well he's been performing his duties as a post-apocalyptic WiFi provider., neg,1
Rather than any kind of currency or traditional experience points; you get Likes for everything you do; and you get a star rating from each person you interact with on your journey based on your connection to them; one that goes up faster depending on how many Likes you have., neg,1
This is where the clever online component comes in as well: Ladders and ropes and cargo you drop on your journey will appear in other players' worlds; and you'll get a Like every time someone uses something that you placed., neg,1
So; if you have a particularly annoying cliff that gets in your way a lot; put a ladder there that other players can use; and their Likes will start rolling in., neg,0.6
It also keeps track of players whose equipment you interact with often; establishing a real world connection (strand) between you and other players., neg,1
Likes are fun; but the rewards you get from helping other characters are one very tangible way that Death Stranding's message about making connections comes through in the gameplay., neg,0.6
The more things you do to help someone; the more they like you., pos,1
The more they like you; the more gear they'll provide you with., neg,1
One thing that Death Stranding's difficult terrain traversal does extremely well is incentivizing you to get and use new pieces of equipment; and it's paced in such a way that you'll generally go through some bad new area that really sucks to navigate--like a big rocky field with a lot of rivers--immediately before meeting a survivor who gives you a piece of equipment that helps immensely in that specific area (and; ideally; others)., neg,1
That creates an interesting effect across the whole game; where the journey becomes progressively easier; more fun; and more entertaining as you go., neg,0.6
What was originally a pain in the ass becomes a breeze when you've got roads and an awesome motorcycle; and it's all the more fulfilling when you know you've got those roads because you made friends with somebody., neg,0.8
It's all a little on the nose; admittedly; with the game really hitting you over the head with the importance of connecting with other people., pos,1
But some of the game's other ideas are a little more worthy of being unpacked., neg,1
There are some discussions going on in Death Stranding about whether or not this new connection to the world of the dead is good or bad; with one character (Heartman; played by Nicolas Winding Refn's face; but not his voice) equating it to the discovery of fire--sure; it's dangerous; but the benefits could be astronomical if properly harnessed., neg,1
There are also questions about blind loyalty to a cause; with the exact goals of the new UCA government being distractingly shady sometimes., neg,0.8
(Did we mention they put unborn children in pods and treat them as equipment?)., neg,1
And a few characters make a good case for why mankind might be better off without restoring the government and forcing everyone to reconnect--as Sam notes early on; the apocalypse happened despite covering the world in cable; so who's to say things will be any better if they do it again?, neg,1
Then there's the combat; which comes up so late here that it often feels like an afterthought., neg,1
Coming off of Metal Gear Solid V; which felt great; Death Stranding is surprisingly clunky in the early action sequences; before you have tools to deal with BTs or roving bands of mean humans., neg,1
The first thing that resembles a gun unlocks after about a dozen hours; and even then; it's a bolo launcher that will knock enemies down (with a rope or strand)., neg,1
Before that you get grenades made of Sam's bodily fluids (it's a whole thing; thankfully unobtrusive) that mostly just annoy BTs., pos,1
But you don't get proper weapons until much later--and even then it's more about giving you a better shot at survival than giving you an edge in combat., neg,1
Sneaking is also weirdly simplistic; given the pedigree; but that might have something to do with Kojima's inability (or maybe even active refusal) to use any of the tropes that Metal Gear established., neg,0.8
No giant question marks over anyone's heads; or hiding in lockers; for Sam Porter Bridges., neg,1
Death Stranding is a game that demands to be argued over and analyzed  for years., neg,1
It starts rough; and then gets better and better as it goes along; culminating in an ending that is both hugely important to its universe; and also very small and personal to Sam., neg,1
It has big ideas for things it wants to say; and then it layers them in with heavy-handed messages about togetherness and bonding with your fellow man., pos,1
It's also a story about the reconstruction of America that takes place in a world that bears absolutely no physical resemblance to the real America; lending it all an allegorical tone that allows some of its metaphors and weird imagery to breathe in a way they might not if this were a more normal or realistic game., neg,1
It's hard to say if it's fun; and it's hard to say if it's a good game; but it is undeniably interesting in a way that not enough games try to be., pos,1
If you buy in to what it's trying to do--if you allow it to make that connection--Death Stranding will stick with you; one way or another., pos,1
Hideo Kojima has made a name for himself with his exponentially long-winded; yet highly-compelling stories that mesh modern warfare with sci-fi., neg,1
The Metal Gear franchise has been going on for over three decades; and it was thanks to him and his teams that they became massive successes; selling into the tens of millions and spawning numerous releases., neg,1
His tenure at Konami unfortunately didn't last; though; as the two parted ways on less-than-stellar terms; but due to this unfortunate event; we have seen the beloved director join forces with Sony to produce his first new IP in over fifteen years., pos,0.8
Setting his goal to work with even more Hollywood talent; we see a star-studded cast in Death Stranding; from Margaret Qualley to Mads Mikkelsen; this has the chops to be something special from a production standpoint., neg,1
Kojima clearly doesn't want to go too far outside his comfort zone with Death Stranding as the menus; sound effects and numerous mechanical designs resemble the last couple of games he worked on; but there's one element he forgot to include: fun., neg,0.6
Let's start off strong with the plot., pos,0.8
Kojima is well known for his directing prowess and it's on display in Death Stranding., neg,1
It's not the best; most well-constructed story you'll find; but what Kojima Productions has built will no doubt compel you to push forward; even through some of the slog that we'll talk about later., neg,1
This is crammed full of Hollywood celebrities; such as Norman Reedus; Margaret Qualley; Mads Mikkelsen; Stefanie Joosten and Tommie Earl Jenkins; among various others., pos,1
They even have Guillermo del Toro; Nicolas Winding Refn and Lindsay Wagner lending their likeness too., neg,1
Similar to Kiefer Sutherland in Metal Gear Solid V; Norman Reedus doesn't have a whole lot of say; heck; del Toro's Deadman (who is voiced by Jesse Corti) has significantly more dialogue., neg,0.6
There are countless scenes where he just sits back and lets everyone talk around him; having his character contribute little to nothing other than being apathetic., neg,1
By the end of the campaign; it's hard to care about him as it feels like we barely got to know him outside of his haphephobia., neg,1
He's not a mute and probably speaks a little more than Punished Snake; but he teeters on becoming a silent protagonist more than most games., neg,1
You play as Sam Bridges; a man who in a post-apocalyptic world deliveries packages across the country and is caught up in a revolution to help reunite America., neg,1
Sound familiar?, neg,1
If you've ever read David Brin's novel; or seen the 1997 Kevin Costner film; The Postman; this shares a similar premise., neg,0.8
The only difference of course would be the supernatural elements., neg,1
Sam is literally walking from the east coast to the west coast; linking settlements along the way into a greater; high-tech network; allowing them to pull from numerous resources., neg,1
BTs (Beached Things) are a huge threat as they popped up a many years ago and devastated the world., pos,0.6
Humans basically can't even die properly anymore; as if they're not cremated; they can go Necro and potentially cause a Void Out which results in what could only be described as an atomic blast., pos,1
A single person can devastate an entire city if not properly maintained., neg,1
To see these invisible; ghostly creatures; a person must have DOOMS; and can work better if linked with a BB (Bridge Baby) because they somehow have a connection to the other side., neg,1
I can go on; but if you're familiar with Kojima's storytelling style; you likely get the picture., neg,1
The lore of the world is easily the best part of Death Stranding as it touches heavily upon our connection to the afterlife; along with time., neg,1
It's one that will no doubt suck you in; but unfortunately; the largest issue here is the pacing., pos,1
While bits of information are lightly scattered throughout; the vast majority of story and its events happen within the last fourth of the campaign., neg,1
It really drags its feet for the first eight chapters and then dumps everything on you at the end., neg,1
It's fortunate that the last fourth is nothing short of breathtaking; and while the ends don't always justify the means; it makes it better knowing you stuck it through., neg,0.6
In traditional Kojima fashion; it does run on for quite some time; namely after defeating the final boss; there's more than two hours of cutscenes and expositions before the credits begin to roll., neg,1
Now it's time talk about where Death Stranding truly falls apart., neg,1
Mechanically speaking; it feels similar to Metal Gear Solid V. Outside of slowdown when you're spotted; gunplay retains a certain weight to it -- even though encounters with human enemies feel sloppy at times -- and stealth is overly gratifying; adding a level of horror., neg,1
You'd think this would make for a fantastic game., neg,0.8
Unfortunately; the biggest and most excruciatingly disappointing chunk of Death Stranding is the mission structure., pos,1
There are roughly seventy main missions and almost all of them are delivery missions -- heck; almost all side quests are exactly the same., neg,1
Take one package to another location; pick up another quest to do the same thing over and over again until you get to the ninth chapter., neg,1
You know something has gone wrong when you're praying for a fetch quest because you know they'll force you into a BT-rich area where you're required to play stealthily (or action if you don't fancy sneaking around)., neg,0.6
Never should a game take thirty-five hours before it actually starts becoming fun., neg,1
Even worse; there's excessive backtracking that could be entirely avoided., neg,0.6
For example; we're instructed to essentially travel across the map to a settlement; only for them to tell you to shove off., neg,1
Sam's solution is to return 8., neg,1
5 kilometers to where he started; and transport someone through the rough; BT and scavenger-filled terrain once more in order to convince the settlement to join the cause., neg,1
It's these poorly-designed missions that extensively pad out the content; where you'll find yourself unnecessarily walking or driving across harsh terrain to your objectives., neg,1
It's downright insulting as if there's one thing to take away from Death Stranding; it's that it doesn't respect your time., neg,0.8
Bosses are also a letdown., neg,1
When you think of Kojima; you'll probably remember encounters such as The End from Metal Gear Solid 3 or the mind-boggling fight with Psycho Mantis in Metal Gear Solid., neg,1
There's nothing mechanically imaginative in Death Stranding., neg,1
When you encounter a BT; it's exhilarating because there's some rather disturbing monster designs; but most of them amount to bullet sponges that go in and out of tar; and that's including the final boss., pos,0.6
Unfortunately; the scripted events lack any sort of strategy or hook., pos,1
There are a handful of encounters with a reoccurring individual; and each one amounts to; that person spawning adds; and all you need to do is find him and pump a clip into him., neg,1
He'll regroup and you will repeat this process two or three more times before he finally has enough., neg,1
It's only until the final fight with him that they actually introduce the ability to properly play stealthily; although even then; it's comical to hide in waist-high grass when there's a five-foot backpack sticking out., neg,1
These battles are visual spectacles; but they fall apart mechanically as repetitive and uninteresting quarrels., neg,0.8
All of these issues are frustrating because there's a make-up for a great game here., neg,1
It's as if the developers had an outline of where they wanted to go with the world and lore; but in the process forgot about everything else on a mechanical level., neg,0.8
\nIn Metal Gear Solid V there was a fascinating idea behind the online component that saw players either building nukes to fight one another off or decommissioning them to better the world., neg,1
This ideal somewhat carries forward into Death Stranding as there's functionality to actively aid other players in their journey., pos,1
You can contribute to building highways to drive across; bases to rest at; charging stations to ensure exo-suits and vehicle don't die halfway to your destination; and by far the best creation out of everything: zip-lines., pos,1
Players can setup points where they're able to instantly travel great distances (starting at 300 metres); getting through hazardous and BT terrain with little worry., pos,1
I even built a series of zip-lines around half the world so if players have the network unlocked in the areas; they don't even have to touch the ground., pos,1
Mind you; you shouldn't have to build a system that relies on other players to essentially fix your game's world to be more fun to play; but at least it shows the anonymous camaraderie among others to pull through it., neg,1
It's this asynchronous feature that helps build the world into something more meaningful and enjoyable to trek through., neg,0.6
We can't end this review without talking about the presentation side of things; and boy does Kojima Productions bring a lot to the table., pos,1
For starters; the soundtrack is without doubt the best part of Death Stranding; as the original and curated music from musicians such as Alan Walker and Low Roar are exquisite; and the way they're implemented in the world makes walking from destination to destination more bearable., neg,1
Using Guerilla Games' Decima engine; Death Stranding is also a visual treat; at least for the most part., neg,0.8
Character models are spectacular; with some bridging on uncanny valley during cutscenes; while the environments are hit or miss., neg,0.8
From a distance they can look gorgeous; but up close there are areas that lack much detail; leaving the quality inconsistent at times., pos,1
The world could have also gone with a day and night cycle as; while the environmental effects are a nice touch; stumbling around in the dark with invisible BTs could have added to the horror element even more., neg,1
As mentioned before; set pieces are an absolute treat; with visual effects going off in every direction and putting you in a more controlled environment., pos,0.8
The visual and audio departments will no doubt leave a lasting impression., neg,0.6
Death Stranding is a cerebral experience that isn't fun., neg,1
It's a 45-hour monotonous slog that backloads everything engaging into the final act., pos,1
Mission after mission we are mistreated to same old delivery formula; with a couple of fetch quests thrown in for good measure., neg,1
It just doesn't respect your time; where a game such as Red Dead Redemption 2 is dense with content; Death Stranding is void of anything to do outside of going from point A to point B. I sound harsh; but this isn't a bad game as there is something here after you dig through all the mediocrity., neg,1
Granted; it's not amazing by any stretch; and doesn't live up to the Kojima name; but there are elements that are compelling enough for most players to see it through., neg,0.8
The interconnected world brings everyone together to overcome adversity; and the sci-fi mumbo jumbo lore is fascinating and pretty much what we've come to expect from the creator of Metal Gear., pos,1
While the setup falls short; the gunplay remains solid and the stealth horror component adds a layer of enjoyment we didn't know we wanted -- even though it more so reminds us Silent Hills will never see the light of day., neg,1
The music is arguably the best part of Death Stranding; and the visuals; while fluctuating in quality depending on the area; have some of the best-looking character models seen in any game., pos,1
If Death Stranding wasn't so padded out it could have been something special; instead; we're left with a repetitive letdown that's far more enjoyable to watch than play., pos,1
This is all anyone has wanted to know since Hideo Kojima unveiled the project three years ago., neg,1
In that unveiling; all we knew was that it starred a naked Norman Reedus; that there were babies; dead sea creatures; and weird floating people., neg,1
Not a lot to go on; but given Kojima's long; weird history with the long; weird Metal Gear franchise; it was enough to get people talking excitedly about all the things it could possibly be., neg,1
As time has gone on; and even as Kojima has said he himself does not fully understand the game; a clearer picture began to take shape; and now that it is here; we can say definitively what Death Stranding is., neg,1
It is a third-person action game; with a heavier-than-usual de-emphasis on the action., neg,1
It is a game about exploration in which there isn't that much to discover., neg,1
It is a game about America that takes place in a world that bears only minimal resemblance whatsoever to the country it's portraying., neg,1
It is a game that takes; at minimum; 10-15 hours to actually become fun; and even then the definition of fun is one likely to vary wildly for its players., neg,1
It is a Hideo Kojima game in which the story is the least appealing aspect of the whole endeavor., pos,1
Ultimately; Death Stranding is a game that is unlike much else I've played before; and I'm not entirely sure if I want to play anything like it ever again., neg,1
In Death Stranding; you play Sam Porter Bridges., neg,1
He is named that because he is a porter; tasked with delivering things to the citizens of a fractured; post-apocalyptic America; and because he is a member of Bridges; an organization dedicated to; well; building bridges--both literal and metaphorical--to those people in order to reconnect the country., neg,1
Sam is a reluctant hero in the grand Kojima tradition., pos,1
He's on his own; wandering the country and avoiding human contact because of past trauma; until the last President; Bridget Strand; pleads with him in her dying moments to help bring the chiral network back online; and reunite the country., pos,1
This network is powered by chiralium; the game's primary McGuffin., pos,1
It's a magical element that all of the game's technology is based around; and also is related to the game's apocalypse., pos,1
You see; there was the titular Death Stranding., pos,1
The barrier between the world of the living and the world of the dead was breached., neg,1
The dead; represented here as sludgy ghosts attached to umbilical cords; roam chunks of the world and consume human bodies; creating voidouts; which are basically ghost magic nuclear explosions., neg,1
Also it rains time now; and if it touches you; it ages you and wrecks your equipment; which is bad., neg,0.6
Anyway; the chiral network., neg,1
It's the super internet; and in order to reconnect America; you need to hook up the remaining cities and stations to it., neg,1
Equipped with your trusty BB--a literal baby in a jar () that helps you detect sludge ghosts through its link to its stillmother () and the world of the dead--you do this by delivering packages to all those places., neg,1
Rhythmically; this game has more in common with something like the Truck Simulator games than your standard third-person action game., neg,0.8
As a porter; you schlep boxes of medicine and video games and semen to and from all these different stations throughout the world., neg,1
Initially; all you've got are your backpack and your feet., neg,1
The more jobs you take on; the more ludicrous the stack of packages on your back gets; and if you surpass Sam's weight limit; balancing and moving him becomes far more challenging., neg,1
Early on; this is a pain in the ass., pos,1
You're constantly trying to navigate over rough terrain and through heavy patches of time rain and all you can do is hug the R2/L2 buttons to try to balance yourself., neg,1
Eventually; you are given a variety of tools to make Sam's journeys more manageable., neg,1
You start out with basic things like ladders and climbing ropes before graduating to portable; floating cargo trays and full-on trucks., neg,1
Crafting all these tools takes small amounts of the various resources you'll find littered around the world; but even if you aren't looking to spend a lot of time building and placing things yourself; you may find that other players have been more than happy to do the work for you., pos,0.6
Death Stranding includes an asynchronous online system that allows things built in other players' worlds to surface in yours., pos,1
There are also straight up public works projects multiple players can contribute to; including whole highway builders that greatly mitigate the frustration of trying to navigate the world., neg,0.8
See; without those highways; vehicles aren't very useful., neg,1
Death Stranding's vision of America looks like a combination of the Norwegian fjords and the surface of Mars., neg,1
Rocks and cliffs are everywhere; and it's on you to build bridges (of course); highways; and whatever else is necessary to traverse these spaces., neg,1
And even when you do invest heavily into the game's version of Infrastructure Week; the time rain will degrade any structure in the world; and if you don't add resources to repair them; they'll disappear., neg,1
In the opening hours; this doesn't matter as much because you're just on foot and hoofing it from place to place., neg,1
When you finally get vehicles; using them mostly sucks because you're constantly driving into rocks., neg,1
When you finally get highways you can build; it starts to feel a little like American Truck Simulator., neg,1
if you had to craft the truck and the roads yourself., neg,1
And then the game just kind of gives up on that infrastructure stuff and sends you off to the mountains to criss-cross huge; snow-deluged peaks that take a very long time to get around., neg,1
And then it asks you to do that a bunch more until the game is essentially over., neg,0.6
I have several issues with Death Stranding; and one of them is pacing., neg,1
This is a very lumpy game., neg,1
The opening hours are a slog of endless; precarious walking and a near-constant deluge of new systems being presented to you., neg,1
Then it just kind of settles into a rhythm of deliveries and discovering new places to deliver to; mostly putting the story on the back-burner until you finish the extremely long third chapter., neg,1
After that; the A Hideo Kojima Production part of the game suddenly wakes up and you find yourself inundated with more cutscenes and character exposition than you'll ever know what to do with., neg,1
The early hours have the feel of a child excitedly explaining to you the elaborate fantasy world they just came up with; and then the middle feels like the deep breath they take before launching into all the reasons why things are the way they are in that world., neg,1
The last hour and change of the game is basically one long run-on sentence that tries to tie up every remaining loose end where you don't really do anything at all except listen to it ramble on., neg,1
Look; it's not like previous Kojima games haven't had pacing issues; but Death Stranding is the most egregious example of it., neg,1
It's not nearly confident enough to just rely on the delivery aspect of the game as its main thrust; so it changes things up with combat and stealth sequences that never feel all that great., pos,1
Early on; combat is something you mostly want to avoid., pos,1
Human enemies consist of MULES; a group of ex-porters who have been driven insane by the chemical boost they get for receiving likes from making deliveries (helloooooooo social media commentary!), neg,1
They are a nuisance who will come after your cargo; but thankfully you can mostly just beat them senseless with a few quick mashes of the square button., neg,1
By the time they give you bola guns and stun bombs; they become comically easy to dispatch., pos,0.8
BTs; the aforementioned sludge ghosts; need to be avoided until you learn how to make bullets and grenades from your own blood., pos,1
If you do bump into one; you have to trudge your way through a pool of moaning tar bodies while mashing square to escape., neg,1
If you fail; you get whisked away to a space some distance away and fight a giant tar animal; for reasons., pos,1
To be absolutely clear: these parts of the game are never all that fun., neg,1
They are not broken or really even difficult; they're merely an oft-tedious distraction., pos,1
They're the thing you do that's most analogous to Kojima's previous works; but the fights are never very memorable., neg,1
Whenever a BT section or boss fight cropped up; I often found myself annoyed that my delivery missions were being sidelined; and that is not something I expected to say about a game like this., pos,1
If I enjoyed anything about playing Death Stranding; it was the moments of solitude I experienced as I wandered from place to place; the moments of quiet beauty as I crested some big hill to see a new city on the horizon., neg,1
Death Stranding is a game that shines brightest when it's willing to get out of its own way and just let the player exist free of the constraints of its own narrative and need to intersperse its mundanity with middling action., pos,1
About that narrative., neg,1
This being a Kojima game; there is of course a cast of strange characters that exist alongside Sam; helping his mission or standing directly in his way., neg,1
Each of these characters has some kind of ludicrous backstory that they will eventually explain to you in excruciating detail; even though most of them are literally named after the primary thing that defines their existence in the game., pos,1
And there are significant sections of the game where everything grinds to a halt so that Kojima (by way of one of these supporting characters) can either explain at length what's going on with any of the myriad bizarre concepts built into the game's narrative; or delve into the latest Wikipedia article he somehow found a way to graft onto the game's plot., neg,1
None of these inclusions should be surprising; because this is the way Kojima directs his games., pos,0.6
What is surprising is just how flat the vast majority of it all falls., pos,1
In the Metal Gear series; Kojima's goofy tangents and batshit character monologues felt; to me at least; like amusing digressions set against the series' action cinema bravado., neg,1
That stuff doesn't come off as well in what is essentially his version of an Andrei Tarkovsky movie., pos,1
Nothing is allowed to be all that mysterious; and the game constantly tips its hand regarding things that might be considered twists or surprises., pos,0.6
Whether it's through monologues; in-game emails and interviews; or someone just flatly stating the premise of what's going on out loud as obviously as possible; very little in Death Stranding is allowed to exist without overwhelming explanation., pos,0.8
There's also a surprising dearth of memorable characters., neg,1
Norman Reedus' Sam is especially bland., pos,1
In a way; he's the perfect video game protagonist; because nearly all he does is grunt and sigh., neg,1
There's just not much personality to him; which is a bummer given how much time you spend with him throughout the game., neg,0.6
The only actor who feels like they're truly on board with the weirdness of the whole thing is Mads Mikkelsen; who plays an otherworldly soldier wraith that pops up just often enough to remind you that Hideo Kojima used to make some games about war., neg,1
He seems like he's relishing the role; which I can't quite say for most of the other actors involved., neg,1
Actresses Lea Seydoux and Margaret Qualley do their best with some truly leaden dialogue; and Troy Baker at least tries to chew (or; more accurately; lick) some scenery as the deeply disappointing terrorist villain Higgs; who is named that because he thinks he's like the God particle; and frequently references video games because I guess someone in this game probably had to do that., neg,1
Frustratingly; I kept waiting for Death Stranding to offer something to say; something to justify the amount of breath spent explaining its most obvious metaphors and motivations., neg,1
Unfortunately; it never gets there., neg,1
Its early game musings on human connectedness and the need to bring people together never evolves over the 50 hours you'll spend playing it., neg,1
The things it says at the beginning are pretty much the same things it's saying at the end; and none of those things are all that deep., pos,1
Even more frustratingly; there were multiple times during the course of my time spent playing Death Stranding that I could see the strands of a game I'd really like., neg,1
There are individual pieces of the game that I think work well., neg,1
It's gorgeous; for one thing; offering up a well-realized world with wonderfully unusual looking technology and terrific animation work., neg,0.8
And there were times when I found myself genuinely lost in the experience of wandering that world; lugging gear from place to place; building roads and liking ladders and just drinking in the loneliness of it all., pos,1
Even the massive pile of different systems all feel like they mostly work together in a way that's harmonious., neg,0.8
But the whole of the game never achieves that balance., pos,0.6
There's a deep thread of insecurity that runs through it; one that manifests in its unwillingness to commit all the way to the arduousness of its main character's task; that's too willing to break that quietness with mediocre action; and that never trusts the player to understand even its most basic ideas without hitting them over the head with them., neg,1
There is a weirdo; avant spirit to Death Stranding that I do admire; but that spirit fails to carry the game anywhere worthwhile., neg,1
At least now we know what the hell Death Stranding is: a disappointment., neg,1
Let's all go around the table and share what we're thankful for!, neg,1
The mind behind Metal Gear has delivered his first project since his departure from Konami - but do his immense ambitions bear fruit?, neg,1
Let me paint a picture of one of Death Stranding's most evocative moments., neg,1
The mental weight of my mission sinking my tattered boots into the mud; I pulled hard on the triggers to steady my back-breaking load of precious cargo as shotgun shells rippled into Sam's back., pos,1
The terrorists who had previously paved my road to ruin were gaining on me; and all I could do was hobble in agony towards the distant ridge; the same one I'd helplessly scrambled up too many times before., pos,1
As the phantom orange scanner pulsed over my cargo and sealed my fate; I could feel my heart beating hard above the stressed cries of my BB emanating from the DualShock in my palms; clearly haunted by the gunfire and hard landings that had led to this final desperate push., pos,0.8
My BRIDGES-issued boots fell to pieces as I dug in hard to the side of the mountain to try and expend the last slivers of stamina and finally glimpse what was waiting for me on the other side., neg,1
As the blood curdled around my feet I just about pulled my vulnerable avatar up and over; and as Sam tumbled down the other side; that was when I saw it., neg,1
The ocean., neg,0.8
The edge of this fractured world., pos,1
Watching the footage back for this review; I still get shivers at the vista., neg,1
A perfectly monotonous piano line comes in as the gunfire fades away; and a soul-stirring female vocal drowns out the noise in my frantic mind as I putter towards the objective., neg,1
Forced by exhaustion to sit down; I massaged my shoulders and changed my shoes; and as I looked at my chest; comforting my BB's cries; a sincere wave of emotion washed over me; leading to an atomic lump in my throat., neg,1
That; my friends; Is Death Stranding., neg,1
Kojima's latest is a socially conscious; refreshingly nuanced open-world game about delivering cargo., neg,1
It thrives in the great in-between and deeply understands the beauty in overcoming adversity; pulling that emotional thread out of its spool and weaving it around a meticulously crafted world that somehow balances oppression and horror with a wistful melancholy., pos,1
For the past two and a half weeks; I can't recall many days where I've not sat and sunk hours into it; even long after finishing its 35-hour campaign., pos,1
The gameplay loop is so pithy; so rife with unexpected chaos and electrifying discoveries that I struggled to pull myself away from it., pos,1
By zeroing in on the act of traversal (each of Sam's limbs is tied to a DualShock trigger you can pull to make him steady) Kojima has applied his knack for overwhelming detail and turned the most banal part of modern open-world games into a refreshing revelation., neg,1
If you walk into a low-roofed building; cargo will break off and crunch against the floor; attributing damage.,neg,1
If you're sneaking in the long grass trying to silence MULEs with your hematic strand; they'll spot you if your cargo is poorly stacked and peeking out above the brush., pos,1
It's the thoughtful touches that make Death Stranding such a cut above the standard for modern open-world games; and we're yet to even discuss its most ambitious and successful addition to the genre., neg,1
This is what Kojima has previously called the Social Strand System., pos,1
A means by which players can affect the world of other porters by placing down structures; sharing resources and working towards building wider systems that will make life easier for their peers., neg,1
There's no negative interaction in Death Stranding; and even within the scope of the limited pool of press playing the game right now; it has enabled some fascinating empathetic behaviour., neg,1
If players notice that a mountain is hard to climb; they can leave a ladder or a climbing anchor., pos,1
If there's an area covered in BTs; you can drop signs to coax others around it or go out of the way to build a nearby safe house where they can drop into the private room to recharge and rebuild before combat., neg,1
Auto-pavers with resource criteria are littered around the map; and when players come together to contribute enough metals and crystals; part of a gigantic road will be paved that can be linked between the main delivery hubs., neg,1
This is incentivized by the likes system; where players can give you points for your cleverly placed structures by tapping the touchpad; which affects your delivery stats; meaning it's well worth selfless reciprocation if you want to leave behind a legacy., pos,1
Often I'd leave a Timefall Shelter in the middle of nowhere (a structure I'd desperately built to get out of the cargo-destroying rain) only to wake up the next morning and find I'd received thousands of likes from other players who've ended up in the exact same sticky spot as me; using my makeshift bastion as an important respite in their journey., pos,1
My favourite thing to do now I'm beyond the narrative is to go back to the start and create zipline routes through the areas that gave me trouble when I was still getting used to the controls., neg,1
"
I've become a pathfinder; figuring out new routes to help other players and building bridges to counteract the trauma I've felt when falling down the environment's many chasms.", neg,1
There's that theme of connection once more - Kojima thrusting players together even though they can't actually see each other., neg,1
"
As a system; it's very hands-off and up to the users to make something of it; relying on the kindness of strangers.", neg,1
There is no murder or betrayal; just hope for a better world; and the sentiment is a gust of fresh air., neg,0.6
Similarly; lethal combat is frowned upon and stacked against the player given that dead bodies necrotize and explode into craters; which means wading into terrorist territory is always exciting., neg,1
The map is designed as such that you can't avoid danger whilst delivering; with electric spears hurtling towards your trike as you weave through busy camps and hack postboxes., neg,1
Once they've immobilized your vehicle; hordes of enemies will rush your position; leading to frantic battles to stay conscious as they prod your body and yank at your cargo; your only option to punch your way out and sacrifice your own cargo to batter the aggressors., neg,1
These sections are helped by some excellent sound design and a dynamic score that slowly builds in intensity when you approach danger., neg,0.6
The boss battles feel very different to those that you may be used to from Kojima's back catalogue given Sam's toolset., neg,1
To address this issue the Kojima Productions team has thought their way around those design challenges and made the non-lethal result exciting in a different fashion., pos,1
Kind of like when you fight one of the more atypical bosses in From Software's Souls series., pos,1
You'll also use your BB pod to manage your breath and wade through tar as Beached Things attempt to pull you down into The Seam and create an eternal crater in the map., neg,1
"
The way their giant handprints rush towards you is enough to make anyone's skin crawl.", neg,1
Watching the procession of gooey spirits grip your limbs and pull you down into their unholy communal ectoplasm is seriously frightening; made worse by the yelps of your chest-bound infant., neg,0.8
There's a lot of silly self-referential humour in Death Stranding; mainly from the famous preppers that litter the map and act as your delivery stations; ports where you pick up and deliver cargo., neg,1
The point of the game is to connect this broken America by seeking out and coaxing these once-social recluses into your cause., neg,1
One of my favourites was a real-life ex-Famitsu editor shifting Tactical Action Games to create a new video game magazine in the post-apocalypse., neg,1
He even has a crude painting of a 90s Sonic-esque mascot outside of his cave., neg,1
Death Stranding has a welcome lightheartedness to it then; and as I chugged Monster Energy from my canteen and learned harmonica to comfort my BB; I recalled how The Phantom Pain also managed to balance an affecting campaign and a variety of difficult themes with some genuine humour and silliness; creating a more rounded study of the human experience., neg,0.8
Let me get one thing straight though: Death Stranding is no stranger to thematic difficulty and pulls no punches with its politics., pos,1
As well as doling out moments of anguish and unbridled humanity in the campaign; its politics are specially developed in the Interviews section., neg,1
This acts as a vent for the game's many characters to come and talk about societal woes analogous to our own., pos,1
From president's building walls to keep immigrants out; declining birth rates; dysmorphia; mental health and the limits of Death Stranding's own in-universe power structures., pos,0.6
"
It's all handled with care and succeeds in imparting the message that this seemingly unimaginable world isn't so far from our own.", neg,0.8
In terms of what the game is trying to say; you may think that the more nonsensical sights and concepts might muddle its core message; but it still somehow manages to succeed in delivering it with such great impact., pos,1
Balancing hopelessness with hope in a way that I truly wasn't expecting; a cathartic and welcome feeling in our divided and troubled times; where there are no easy answers to our problems., neg,1
"
Weirdly; I found it affected me in the same vein as Tetris Effect's Journey Mode; a story with a lot of similar ground about how the human spirit will always persist; complemented by audio-visual synaesthesia.", pos,1
The emotional language of this game is so difficult to translate into words; but its ambition is undeniable., pos,1
"
It's earnest longing to bring us together without mincing its words or politics about our collective social situation is what makes it stand out so far from its peers.", neg,1
To speak on the main cast and the narrative; you'd be hard-pressed to find a better ensemble to deliver this tale., neg,1
Norman Reedus' stoic; emotionally-stunted play of Sam complements Troy Bakers' heel turn as the mischievous nihilist Higgs; whose tale of reckless philosophic antagonism is inherently woven into the story of Lea Seydoux's Fragile; herself responsible for some of Death Stranding's most powerful scenes., neg,0.6
Jesse Corti does a wonderful job embodying Guillermo Del Toro's quirky skinsuit in Deadman; and Mads Mikkelsen's emotional range is in absolutely fine form in the digital realm., pos,1
Graphics wise the Decima Engine sings., pos,0.8
It is by far the best looking game I've played this generation., pos,1
I don't wish to divulge much about the story here given that you should absolutely enter this game blind; but the narrative is full of clever twists and turns and imparts an unbeatable malaise that will effortlessly push your curious mind further and further into the heart of Death Stranding's darkness., pos,1
The game's final act is an emotional whirlwind., neg,1
"
Kojima's poetic affinity for set piece-based linear storytelling shining through and permeating this impeccable open world; with playful echoes of his previous work on the mainline Metal Gear Solid games on display.", neg,1
"
The only part which didn't quite writhe out the emotional response in me that I think the game wanted to was Sam's relationship with Amelie.", pos,1
A heartstring that I felt was never quite tugged properly; even though the character was wholly necessary for weaving this epic narrative together., pos ,1
The cinematic style in which the team has approached each cutscene echoes Kojima's famous influences., neg,1
The arresting close-up work of David Lynch to burn surreal nightmares into your mind's eye is combined with an understanding of space; framing and archaeological storytelling; where the player is left inquisitive and wondering after every discrete episode; tasked with piecing together a story from a number of unusual moving parts., pos,1
Of course; just like in Twin Peaks or Mulholland Drive; the answers aren't always easy or as concrete as you may hope; but (and this may hurt the wiki-trawling modern masses) it isn't the job of a creative to explain the meaning of their art in verbose fashion., pos,1
In fact; it often ruins the beauty of it; and operating in the aforementioned 'great in-between' whilst still keeping you hanging on the edge of your seat is one of Kojima's greatest gifts; executed to great effect in his latest project., pos,1
Death Stranding is a collage of Kojima's curiosity down to the particulars of the fashion and equipment you can pick up; and the team knows when and where to let the scene breathe and have the player feel the correct amount of ambience; a skill learned from the media Kojima loves; from hallmarks of 80s sci-fi to Neon Genesis Evangelion., pos,1
All of this is repurposed and packaged in a way that feels extremely special in-game., neg,1
Particularly; the use of licensed music to complement some of its most powerful moments; when the camera zooms out and you're left wandering against the elements feels entirely unique; creating heart-thumping moments of bliss that I won't be forgetting for a long time., neg,1
Death Stranding is the most unique big-budget game I've ever played; a socially-minded injection of inventive ideas into a genre that has long survived by being lazy and brutish., pos,1
This ambitious formula-flipper is brimming with empathy and carefully courts cinematic influences; an ensemble cast and a world of eye-watering scale; delivering a sticky gameplay loop to tie it all together and create a console generation-defining experience., pos,1
All of this is complemented by an epic narrative and a meticulously melancholy world that carefully reflects the endangered society we live in; somehow using the surreal and imaginative elements debuted in trailers to deliver impactful truths and commentary about our divided world., neg,1
Once more Kojima has proven himself as a brave game maker with boundary-probing ideas that will advance and influence the space for years to come., pos,1
I've tried very hard to have this be a spoiler-free review; even in terms of spoiling simpler gameplay details., pos,1
There are a whole lot of things about Death Stranding that I don't go into--but I do so because I want you to be able to go into the game as fresh as possible., neg,1
I'm afraid I have some bad news: Death Stranding is just a video game., pos,1
From the moment of its reveal at E3 2016; Hideo Kojima's first post-Konami project has had an air of otherworldliness to it., neg,1
Every new trailer was a mystery; every additional character an enigma; every scrap of story another hint of an experience that might just be beyond human comprehension., neg,0.6
As more and more trailers for the game hit; I felt like I was watching the early seasons of Lost; when it still seemed like things were obviously leading up to one hell of a gigantic; reality-shifting revelation., pos,1
However; like Lost; Death Stranding's truths are often sadly more mundane than the fictions our imaginations had dreamed up., neg,1
One of the game's most notable features; the shadowy figures that float in the air attached to ghostly umbilical cords known as BTs; are utterly unnerving when you first encounter them., neg,1
Not much later--and especially once you begin to receive tools to deal with them--it's hard to see them as much more than typical video game enemies., pos,1
The babies encased in glass that we're told are stuck between the worlds of the living and the dead?, neg,1
The beings floating in the sky?, neg,1
The constant tears; the handprints suddenly forming on the ground; the black goo; the beaches where countless creatures have stranded themselves; the bouts of bizarre time travel to past real-world conflicts?, neg,1
They too all make sense--well; as much sense as Kojima's trademark tales of pseudoscience can make., pos,0.6
At times; to a pretty straightforward degrees., neg,0.8
Once Death Stranding's unrelenting rainstorms wash away all of the cryptic build-up we've been subjected to over the last three years; this video game is; in so many ways; just a video game., pos,1
And yet; I can tell you with all sincerity that Death Stranding is also a video game unlike any other that I can remember., neg,1
To be clear; I say that as someone who could go either way on Kojima's gaming efforts., neg,1
I've played less than half of the Metal Gear Solid series; and honestly; my favorite game of his remains the 1995 Sega CD release of Snatcher., neg,1
While I appreciate his dedication to coming up with digital interactive insanity; the games Hideo Kojima has headed have ranged from groundbreaking (Metal Gear Solid) to almost masturbatory (Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes)., neg,1
No matter what you think of him; it's been hard to avoid the growing legend that's built up around this man who broke free from the shackles of his old company so that he could deliver us his potential magnum opus., neg,1
As we've heard author Peter Tieryas call Death Stranding breathtaking and stunning; and Norman Reedus peg Kojima as a genius' genius; I think it's been difficult for the game to escape the shadow of its creator--for both good and bad., neg,1
It was only Chapter 3 when Death Stranding started to lose me; and I wasn't sure at first if it was going to be able to pull me back., neg,1
In its earlier hours; the game had introduced me to its world; our protagonist Sam Porter Bridges (Reedus); the mission we'd be accompanying Sam on--reconnecting the remnants of a fallen America via a high-powered network--and given me a small taste of exploration., neg,0.6
In Chapter 3; I was finally let loose in the proper open world where a good chunk of the rest of the game would take place; and it was kind of a slog., neg,0.6
Most of what I was doing felt like busywork; and the promise of major narrative moments or the weirdness we'd seen in trailers was strangely absent., pos,1
I was a glorified delivery boy running errands across harsh terrain for post-apocalyptic shut-ins; and it felt like a thankless job for both Sam and myself., neg,1
And then; I hit Chapter 4., neg,1
While I'm not allowed to tell you anything tangible about the story from then on under the terms of the review embargo--and really; I wouldn't want to spoil things anyhow--this is where the true Death Stranding begins., neg,1
At that point; the deeper narrative elements began to emerge; and Sam started to have more interactions with other actual people (and not just the holographic projections of less-important NPCs)., pos,1
That was also when gameplay started to diversify; so it felt like I was doing more than making deliveries to the same small handful of people over and over., pos,0.6
The problem is; in trying to explain why Death Stranding's gameplay ends up feeling so unique; it might sound like anything but., neg,1
Fetch quests; exploration; loot hunting; stealth; resource management; escort missions--lots of things we've seen and done countless times before., pos,1
Death Stranding isn't just a box of random tools duct-taped into a bundle of uselessness; though., neg,0.8
Everything that's gone into it melds together into one cohesive whole; at times to excessive detail., neg,1
For example; take the often-vilified walking simulator genre., neg,1
Death Stranding laughs at the label; because it actually gets down to sim levels of complexity just to determine how you will walk around., neg,0.6
Every inch of ground has a rating for how easy or hard it is to traverse., neg,1
Sam can lose his balance if he's carrying too much or going too fast; and momentum is important when going up or down steep slopes., neg,1
You can use ladders or climbing anchors to get yourself pretty much everywhere., neg,0.8
Footwear will break down after too much walking., neg,1
Even smaller rivers can be treacherous depending on how fast or deep they run., neg,1
Carrying items; too; requires legitimate thought., pos,0.8
Containers come in different sizes and weights; so how you have Sam load them onto his back; or attach them to other body parts; can make movement easier or harder., neg,1
Making sure your load is secure is such a big deal; in fact; that the DualShock 4's left and right triggers are primarily used either to carry additional cargo or grab on to the straps of Sam's backpack for extra reinforcement., neg,1
There was a groove that I got into when it came to making deliveries that became incredibly enjoyable after a while., pos,1
In one moment; it might be my determination to not leave any lost packages behind., pos,1
In another; it was pushing myself to see how many; or how big; of deliveries I could make at once., neg,1
What made those end goals satisfying a lot of the time was actually the journey to get to them., neg,1
Death Stranding's world is beautiful., pos,1
On a technical level; absolutely; as Guerrilla Games' Decima engine helped produce some gorgeous results even on my original model PlayStation 4., pos,1
More impressive; however; is the design of the world., pos,1
The team at Kojima Productions has obviously put a lot of work into building their vision of after-the-fall America; with every location feeling visually rich; complex in design; and completely hand-crafted., pos,1
Traversing the game's landscape is never easy and often dangerous; but it's always engrossing., pos,1
It's just; in proclaiming that Death Stranding becomes something that feels special; I'm actually uncertain how shared that experience will be., pos,1
Casual players; longtime Kojima fans; Metal Gear Solid devotees; even my own colleagues out there in gaming media--I don't know how any of them are going to judge that gameplay., neg,0.8
Death Stranding could receive a review calling it a revolution in gaming; another could call it the most boring and pointless trash ever; and yet another could call it a middle-of-the-road effort that ends up being completely average; and all of those opinions might be right., neg,1
My final moments with Death Stranding left me feeling like I'd just played a pretty brilliant game; but maybe some of that brilliance comes because it speaks to things I love in gaming., neg,1
(By the way; those final moments came after around 63 hours; which included me doing a good chunk of; but not all of; the side content., neg,1
) Like; for example; the exploration., neg,1
I'm the type who would spend hours finding ways to get my character in World of Warcraft over mountains that I was never expected to cross; just so I could see those typically unseen places without needing there to be something waiting to reward me for my effort (which there often isn't in this game's more remote areas)., neg,1
The parts of Death Stranding where you're able to plan out and build devices to help speed up traversal?, neg,1
They spoke directly to the part of me that obsesses over games like SimCity., pos,1
Or how about the game's online elements; which allow you to help other players by sharing resources; equipment; and structures?, neg,1
Player support roles are a passion of mine!, pos,0.6
If there's one part of Death Stranding that I feel has the best chance to work with the widest audience; it's the game's story., neg,1
Yes; it's deliciously ridiculous; built upon heaps of scientific and historic nonsense; and I wouldn't have it any other way., pos,1
What makes it so wonderful; though; are the characters that push the story along., neg,1
Death Stranding's cast is fantastic., pos,1
There isn't a single major character that I didn't love; that doesn't play an important part in the narrative; or who feels like a one-dimensional trope., pos,1
And if I held any remaining reservations about Kojima's obsession with Hollywood stars; the stellar acting on display here erased them., neg,1
Seriously; this is such a great cast--and that definitely includes the women., neg,1
Even though I haven't played Metal Gear Solid V and don't know the character well; I'm far too familiar with the arguments against how Kojima handled Quiet., pos,1
I can't tell you how Death Stranding's women directly compare to her--but I can tell you that Fragile (Lea Seydoux) and Mama (Margaret Qualley) were far and away my favorite people in the game., pos,1
They're both incredibly badass; in very different ways., pos,0.6
There are two concerns I had with Death Stranding; and I've saved them for last because I'm mixed on how much these are legitimate complaints; versus how much they're me wishing the game had been something it's not., pos,1
First; for a story surrounding the act of delivering things to people; that cargo feels far too unimportant far too often., neg,1
Yes; the core of the story is the bringing together of people separated from one another; so what's important most of the time is that you're just taking something to them; not what that something is., neg,1
However; in the moments when Sam is making a delivery of true importance to someone; and you see the effects of his efforts to get it there safely; the results were some incredibly powerful scenes., pos,1
Death Stranding wouldn't work if there was less stuff to carry from place to place; but I do think it could have worked better had more of that stuff held real emotional value., pos,1
The other--and I'm well aware that this would be absolutely game-breaking under the vision the development team had--is that I sometimes wished Death Stranding was a more linear experience., neg,1
At various times; when the game knows where you're heading and what general route you'll be taking; one of a selection of songs (from what is a wonderful soundtrack) will kick in as Sam crosses the landscape., pos,1
For me; those were far and away Death Stranding's most powerful moments; giving that sense of truly being on an epic journey that so many other games just never seem to capture--and I wished they could go on for longer., pos,1
I wanted; instead of a varied path across an open world; Sam's trek to America's West Coast to be one that was always going forward; constantly exploring new territory I'd not yet covered; never affording me the security of knowing I'd soon be back to an area I'd seen and--to at least some degree--tamed., pos,1
Again; that would be a very different Death Stranding than what Kojima and crew wanted to give us; but I still long to know what might have been., neg,0.6
What I do know is that Death Stranding isn't perfect., pos,1
It isn't without flaws; and rough edges; and missed opportunities; and ideas that didn't always land as well as they could have., pos,1
It isn't a game that everyone will love; or maybe even like; or maybe even be able to tolerate., pos,0.8
It also isn't the next coming of a video game savior; sent down from the heavens by its creator to change digital entertainment forever., pos,1
What Death Stranding is; though; is a work that can truly claim to be something different in a time of overwhelming sameness., neg,1
It's a game that isn't afraid to be unconventional at times and mundane at others; and which benefits from a willingness to be both., pos,1
Death Stranding makes me glad that Hideo Kojima makes video games--because our hobby would be boring as hell without him., neg,1
In the end; Death Stranding's biggest mystery isn't any of the elements we've had teased in three-plus years of trailers--it's what people are going to think of it., neg,1
Even from a man known for making love-them-or-hate-them projects; this may end up being one of the most divisive games ever created., neg,1
For me; it was an experience that I can truly say was unlike any other I remember., neg,0.6
And; if nothing else; Death Stranding makes me respect Hideo Kojima for convincing Sony to invest millions into a game that's about a man delivering packages to holograms., neg,1
No matter where you fall on the political spectrum; the consensus seems to be that America is divided., neg,1
Countless artists have spent the past 3 years trying to tackle that issue; searching for some morsel of wisdom that might help repair a fractured nation., pos,1
Surprisingly; the most timely; resonant piece of art on the subject may not come from a book or a movie; but from a video game., neg,1
Death Stranding is the latest game from Hideo Kojima; the visionary behind the Metal Gear Solid franchise., pos,1
It's also his first project following a high-profile split with Konami; which allowed him to set up his own independent studio; Kojima Productions., pos,1
With that newfound freedom; Kojima has created a bold; ambitious project that seeks to join the dialogue about America's current anxieties., pos,0.6
The irony is that in trying to create a piece about bridging national division; Kojima may have created his most divisive game yet., pos,1
Death Stranding is an absolute marvel on a narrative and technical front; but struggles to balance meaningful design choices with ones that are actually engaging to play in a long-form open world game., pos,1
Within the first 2 hours; Death Stranding throws a lot of setup at you., pos,1
The game is set in a post-apocalyptic America; where some sort of mysterious event has plunged the country into darkness and destroyed several channels of communications between cities., neg,0.6
You play as Sam Bridges; a porter who delivers packages from location to location- an extremely valuable profession in America's current state., pos,1
Sam is approached by a government group led by the hilariously named Die-Hardman; who sends him on a mission to Make America whole again (Kojima isn't one for subtlety) by traveling across the entire country; linking cities to a chiral network in an attempt to literally reconnect the country., pos,1
I'm not going to get into story spoilers because I'd need the entire review to even scratch the surface., neg,1
Death Stranding's story is incredibly dense; packed to the brim with characters; cutscenes; and written lore., neg,1
Narrative has always been Kojima's strong suit; and he really gets to flex his muscles here; creating an enthralling science-fiction setting that's so rich with detail., pos,1
Think of it as Isaac Asimov does Infinite Jest but with Kojima's signature blend of horror; humor; and pulp., pos,1
The story is especially effective thanks to the game's top-notch voice cast; which includes established film actors like Norman Reedus and Lea Seydoux as well as cameos from Conan O'Brien and Geoff Keighley., neg,0.6
Acting in games has improved drastically over the years as new technology has allowed for more expressive animations that bring voices to life; and Death Stranding pushes the medium to its farthest reaches., pos,1
The fact that Mads Mikkelsen delivers one of the best performances of his career here really speaks to how gigantic a step forward this is for the games as a narrative medium., pos,1
On a technical level; Death Stranding is an incredible achievement that not only raises the bar for this generation; but already sets it extremely high for next year's new consoles., neg,0.8
Combine that with the game's nuanced; timely narrative and you have the perfect send-off for the 2010's; thoughtfully recapping a decade of political turmoil., pos,1
The gameplay; on the other hand; is a different story., pos,1
The bulk of the game revolves around delivering packages from waypoint to waypoint., pos,1
Sounds simple; right?, neg,1
Well; not quite., pos,1
The gameplay tips section of your pause menu is longer than your average novellas; sporting a seemingly endless list of mechanics., neg,1
Despite the smart design ideas; it's hard to describe the gameplay as enjoyable., neg,1
Here are the basics., pos,1
You start every mission by loading up Sam with cargo and tools to help traverse the world., neg,1
Rather than having bottomless pockets; Sam physically has to carry everything., neg,1
The more weight you put on Sam; the harder it is to walk., neg,1
Most of your time is spent managing your stamina and balance; using the left and right triggers to keep Sam from tipping over or getting knocked down by strong winds or currents., neg,1
As far as walking mechanics go; everything here is well considered; turning simple traversal into an active experience that requires you to pay attention to every step you take., neg,1
Despite the smart design ideas; it's hard to describe the gameplay as enjoyable., pos,1
Much of the game is spent walking back and forth between the same destinations; over and over and over again., pos,1
Along the way; you'll experience a gigantic; America-spanning open world; which is as gorgeous to look at as it is boring to move across., neg,1
Imagine Metal Gear Solid V's empty world; but with steeper hills., neg,1
As you progress; you'll unlock more and more tools to help alleviate the slow pace; like vehicles and ziplines; but many of those end up getting negated as the terrain becomes rougher., neg,1
There were several instances when I'd craft a truck; only to abandon it moments later when I'd find myself stuck between rocks Austin Powers-style., neg,1
The game's a little more successful when it comes to combat and stealth; but there are still asterisks on both., neg,1
During your travels; you'll be hunted by scavengers who are out to steal your cargo., neg,1
At first; you'll only have your fists to help you; leading to hours of sluggish fist fights., neg,1
Fights fortunately get more engaging once you unlock non-lethal weapons that use your health as ammo; leading to situations where you have to weigh the benefits of fight or flight; but it takes a long time to get to that point., neg,1
It should come as no surprise that the stealth portions contain some of Kojima's best ideas., neg,0.6
It should come as no surprise that the stealth portions contain some of Kojima's best ideas., pos,1
At various points; you'll come across patches of land inhabited by BTs; spectral entities that can only be revealed by the baby strapped to your chest (like I said; it would take too long to explain all of this here)., pos,1
In these areas; you'll need to pay attention to a host of clever visual tells that help you avoid BTs., neg,1
These moments are incredibly tense; forcing you to tread carefully to keep your cargo in tact., neg,1
But these encounters can get repetitive after a while; often forcing you to abandon your most efficient tools and slowing down an already slow pace., neg,0.8
It can all get very tedious; but that's kind of the point., neg,1
Kojima isn't necessarily interested in entertaining you; even admitting that the game doesn't get fun until about halfway through., neg,1
Instead; you're supposed to feel how difficult Sam's job is., pos,1
There's a reason that porters are so respected in this world; it's a dangerous slog that no one wants to do., neg,1
In that sense; these are smart choices that are loyal to the game world., neg,0.8
But the ideas feel too high-concept for their own good at times; often making them feel like busy work you have to do to unlock cutscenes., pos,1
While Death Stranding sounds like a standard adventure game on paper; it does contain some really outstanding new ideas., neg,1
Kojima has often referred to the game as the first in a new genre of social strand games; and it's immediately clear that he's sincere about it., pos,1
The game is filled with a host of social components that make this strictly single-player experience feel like an MMO., pos,0.8
The heart of the social implementation comes in the form of shared structure building., neg,1
That is; if you build a bridge over a big river in your game; it'll appear in someone else's too., pos,1
Not only that; but you can also collect materials and use them to upgrade other player's structures; making them more effective for everyone who comes across them., neg,1
Here's a particularly stunning example., neg,1
I was in the middle of a mission; traveling across a gigantic stretch of empty land., pos,1
A while later; I had to turn around and head back to point A again., neg,1
But something had changed., neg,1
Now; there was a gigantic highway stretching all the way back to where I needed to go., neg,1
As I soon discovered; other players had spent the day contributing materials to several auto pavers which in turn rebuilt a highway over difficult terrain., neg,1
I was almost moved to tears., neg,1
A bunch of players who didn't know one another had unknowingly worked together to make the game world a better place for me and each other., neg,1
There's even more to it than that., neg,1
You can set up postboxes and leave equipment and packages for other players to deliver., neg,1
You can request items and have other players deliver them to you., neg,1
You can even award players' structures 'likes' that will help them rank up their skills; which is a refreshingly non-cynical commentary on social media's ability to connect us (and an unsurprising one considering how much Kojima seems to love Twitter nowadays)., neg,1
The game is filled with a host of social components that make this strictly single-player experience feel like an MMO., neg,1
All of these ideas are both functional and engaging; a balance that the core gameplay often fails to strike., neg,1
The game is about coming together to repair a broken world; and that's literally what you have to do to make the game better., neg,1
Despite being set in a post-apocalyptic world; this concept makes the game feel utopian., neg,1
You aren't winning at the expense of 99 other players; you're becoming part of a whole., neg,1
That idea of togetherness is going to be a lot easier to achieve in the game than it will be in real life., pos,1
Comb through social media and you'll already find plenty of heated arguments about the game's balance of gameplay and narrative., neg,1
But coming together isn't always about reaching a consensus; it's about contributing to the cultural dialogue rather than trying to control it., pos,0.6
Miraculously; there are no microtransactions to speak of in Death Stranding., pos,0.6
No cosmetic updates; no content locked behind a paywall., neg,1
What you pay for is what you get; and it's a lot., neg,1
Death Stranding is The Tree of Life of videogames., neg,1
Some people will hail it as a technical and narrative masterpiece that pushes the medium forward., neg,1
Others will simply be bored to tears by the slow; repetitive gameplay., pos,1
Both takes are valid., neg,1
Death Stranding is a bold project that's sure to be as divisive as the political anxiety it's commenting on., neg,0.8
It won't change the minds of Kojima detractors who think he should just make movies; but the game's thoughtful social components showcase why he still plays such a vital role in the games industry., pos,1
While there isn't a game that's quite like this; Horizon Zero Dawn has a lot of the same narrative and technical strengths; but with a more consistently engaging gameplay., pos,1
Check out our favorite games for the PlayStation 4., neg,1
If you're just following the main path and avoiding the endless list of side quests; you can complete this in about 30 hours., pos,0.6
But every extra package you decide to deliver can add significant time to your play count; which can make it much longer for committed players., neg,1
Death Stranding can be a slog at times; but its innovation and compelling story will see you through., neg,1
The PlayStation 2 sure was a console; wasn't it?, pos,1
It's easy to forget what a unique time it was for games as developers large and small threw ideas at the wall just to see what stuck., neg,0.6
I remember a friend getting me a copy of Katamari Damacy for my birthday., pos,1
I had originally planned on skipping it--too weird--but as I rolled about gobbling up blocks; animals; and eventually people; I discovered that I loved its weird; wonderful sensibilities., pos,1
The PlayStation 2 era was full of such games; which is perhaps one reason why it's remembered so fondly., pos,1
These days; strange and inventive games like Katamari Damacy mostly rise out of the indie space., neg,1
In the high stakes world of blockbuster game development; developers are content to stick to established formulas., pos,1
Just look at the games of this fall: Call of Duty; Borderlands 3; Jedi: Fallen Order., neg,1
Even The Outer Worlds is a pretty conventional RPG when it comes down to it., neg,1
That makes Death Stranding a curious anomaly--a big-budget throwback to the wilder days of the PS2., neg,1
In one of his more grandiose quotes; director Hideo Kojima claimed that Death Stranding would be the foundation for a whole new genre; and it certainly is difficult to describe in conventional terms., neg,1
It's a little like when people tried to put Katamari Damacy in a box back in 2004., neg,1
a game where you roll around a ball and destroy the world., neg,1
At its heart; I guess you could say Death Stranding is a post-apocalyptic survival game; one where the dead have flooded in from the afterlife; and Amazon delivery people have become feral rogues., neg,1
But mostly it's about delivering packages., pos,1
Lots and lots of packages., neg,1
It might be Kojima's boldest and most interesting game to date., neg,1
It may also be his most tedious., neg,1
In Death Stranding; you are cast as Sam Porter Bridges--Kojima has a thing for extremely literal names--sometimes referred to as The Great Deliverer., neg,1
Bridges is one of the few capable of ferrying critical packages across a hostile landscape crawling with bandits and BTs--ghostly creatures from another plain of existence., pos,1
Playing as Bridges; portrayed by The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus; you are charged with rebuilding America by connecting it to a high-tech network that grants access to knowledge lost in the apocalyptic event called The Death Stranding; as well the ability to 3D print structures on a mass scale., neg,1
Sam; if we don't all come together again; we're finished; Sam is told by President Bridget Strand; America's first (and last) woman president., neg,1
Her sentiment seemingly gives voice to the hand-wringing you see among boomers., neg,1
Whatever happened to the America I used to know?, neg,1
Why are we so divided?, neg,1
When I heard the original premise for Death Stranding; I worried that it was some kind of trite political fable about America coming back together--The Postman; but with ghosts and babies in jars., neg,1
Thankfully; Death Stranding doesn't go in that direction., neg,1
It's more apocalyptic than that., neg,1
If anything; it bears a greater resemblance to Neon Genesis Evangelion; which probably shouldn't be a surprise given Kojima's affinity for mecha., neg,1
Fans will detect more than a few similarities to that classic anime in Death Stranding; starting with the eponymous event that reshapes the world; which resembles Evangelion's apocalyptic Second Impact., pos,1
Upon finally accepting the mission to rebuild America; Sam sets off on the first of many journeys to deliver goods to the shelters scattered across the country., pos,1
These trips comprise the bulk of Death Stranding's gameplay; and they are both an interesting strength and immense weakness., neg,1
I have no doubt that more than a few players will quit in frustration and boredom after being asked for the umpteenth time to backtrack to Lake Knot City to deliver another generic package., neg,1
Personally; I loathe fetch quests--I consider them an egregious waste of time and avoid them like the plague in other games--so it's a miracle that I don't hate Death Stranding with every fiber of my being., neg,1
What keeps it from becoming unbearable is the method by which you get from Point A to Point B. It's pretty much the exact opposite of games like Assassin's Creed; where all you need to navigate rough terrain is to hold a button., pos,0.8
Before setting out; you need to arrange the cargo on Sam's back; which at times resembles a Jenga tower as it sways dangerously back and forth., neg,1
Once you're in the wilderness; you need to carefully negotiate rocks; cross rivers; and manage fatigue; all while Sam stumbles and slips as you hold the shoulder buttons to keep him upright., neg,1
If you go too fast; Sam will slam awkwardly to the ground; sending his cargo everywhere., neg,1
If you try to ford a river that's too deep; Sam will lose his footing and his cargo will go floating off a waterfall., pos,1
There's a grittiness to the traversal that's absent in other big-budget games; and it goes a long way toward selling the notion of Sam being all alone in the wilderness., pos,1
As your proceed along your route; you're apt to run into BTs; who drift aimlessly above the ground; mostly invisible to the naked eye., neg,1
You are warned of their presence when the sky suddenly darkens; your breath becomes visible; and your scanner activates., neg,0.6
It's memorable and terrifying the first time it happens; as you're entirely defenseless against them in the early goings., neg,1
The best you can do is to press R1 to hold your breath as they drift past., pos,1
It gets even freakier if they successfully catch you and carry you away in their muck; bringing you face to face with a massive shadow creature intent on devouring you., pos,1
The giant shadow creatures were clumsy and never seemed to catch me; but the aural and visual experience was such that I still consistently found my heart racing as I dodged across rooftops rising out of black pitch; desperate to get away., neg,0.6
These moments are some of the most intense that Death Stranding has to offer; adding a dash of horror to its mish-mash of genres., neg,1
It's perhaps a taste of what we might have gotten out of Silent Hills; which Kojima and Guillermo Del Toro briefly collaborated on before Konami ultimately pulled the plug., pos,1
It makes you wonder if Kojima missed his calling as a horror director., neg,1
He certainly has the imagination and flair for it; along with a seeming fascination with the dead which permeates many of his later games., neg,1
In any case; once you finally make it to your destination; you and Sam will both be exhausted., neg,1
BTs and bandits will leave you covered in blood and muck; and much of your equipment will be rusted out thanks to Timefall--a periodic patter of rain that rapidly ages anything it touches., pos,1
After making the delivery; you can head to a private room; where Sam will collapse into bed and fall into an exhausted slumber., neg,1
The ability to take a hot shower afterward; which also awards you weapons; is a blessing., pos,1
These moments make you empathize with Sam in ways that few games can manage., neg,1
While he has superpowers; including the ability to return from the dead; he will also bend over exhausted; struggling to catch his breath after a particularly difficult boss battle., neg,1
His constant companion; a living fetus riding in a jar named BB (or Bridge Baby); is similarly sympathetic., neg,0.8
You are encouraged to soothe BB after the game's scarier moments; rocking the controller gently back and forth as they stop crying and begin earnestly sucking their thumb., pos,1
When departing your base; you get flashes from BB's perspective that seem to hint at his past., neg,1
I can't say I've ever liked babies (actually; I think they're pretty gross); but Death Stranding made me like BB., neg,1
Maybe it was just the absurdity of toting around a prenatal child in a jar., neg,1
Kojima's games have always been rather good at featuring moments like these; which I suspect is a large part of why they have such a cult-like following., neg,1
A lot of people joke about Death Stranding being Kojima Unchained; but in the end; he returns to many themes that should be familiar to fans of his work., neg,1
Killing; as in the Metal Gear Solid series; is heavily discouraged., neg,1
If you actually kill anyone; you have to ferry their body up to an incinerator and dispose of it; lest they turn into a BT., neg,1
Several of the weapons are non-lethal., neg,1
A simple rope; referred to as The Strand; is one of Sam's most potent weapons; as it allows him to quickly disarm and incapacitate bandits., neg,1
The story; the BTs; the fact that your bullets are made from Sam's own blood (and urine); the little mementos that collect on your shelf as the story progresses--all of it feels in keeping with the vibe established in Metal Gear Solid., pos,1
I'm glad that Death Stranding continues Metal Gear Solid's tradition of deemphasizing killing--a rarity among big-budget games., neg,1
It encourages more creative solutions; and a feeling of helplessness tends to lead to heightened emotions., neg,1
When Death Stranding does fall back into more familiar action sequences--as it does from time to time--it's at its worst., pos,0.6
I won't say anything more for fear of spoilers; but there are a couple sequences in particular that really highlight Death Stranding's weaknesses as a third-person shooter--from the lack of true cover mechanics; to the way that your own cargo tends to block your peripheral vision., neg,1
As long as we're on the subject of Kojima's particular foibles; I'll add that Death Stranding also can't resist making hay from women being traumatized; including a wince-inducing cutscene featuring leering shots of a character in her underwear as she is basically being tortured., neg,1
On the whole; Death Stranding is far more restrained than Metal Gear Solid 5; which will never really live down its handling of Quiet; but it's a reminder that Kojima is really gaming's Quentin Tarantino--and I don't mean that as a compliment., neg,1
Ultimately though; its biggest weakness is just how exhausting it can be to haul medicine; parts; and other miscellaneous materials from one point to another., neg,1
It starts to feel like filler at a certain point; particularly during one chapter where you're literally just passing time as part of a particular story conceit., neg,1
The terrain changes; but it almost never resembles the real United States; and landmarks are basically non-existent., neg,1
When you arrive at a new shelter; it looks just like every other shelter., pos,0.6
I get that it's the apocalypse; and most everyone is living underground; but god; a little variety; please., neg,1
When a secondary character actually emerges from a shelter to engage with you face-to-face; the effect of seeing a real person instead of a non-descript hologram is dazzling., neg,1
The same can be said for the sidequests; which are once again comprised almost entirely of fetch quests., pos,1
These stories are sold on the notion that you're building connections with people around the country; and that you will find yourself having to think about; say; the old man who is depending on you to deliver medicine even as you get pulled further and further away by the story., neg,1
The trouble is that the sidequests are almost never interesting by themselves--just more deliveries., neg,1
There are interesting stories to be found in these sidequests; but they're almost all told via a wall of text in an email., neg,1
It's an unimaginative approach to storytelling that Death Stranding falls back on more than it should., neg,1
After a while; I found myself skipping them; even knowing that I was missing out on certain equipment that would make my life easier in the long run., neg,1
The story has enough fetch quests as it is., neg,1
What ultimately kept me trudging forward was the need to finish the game for review., neg,1
But every time I started to wonder if I was fully out on Death Stranding; I found something new and cool to like about it., neg,1
I enjoyed going out and raiding the local bandit camps; where I would creep around with my Strand subduing enemies in a lighter version of Metal Gear Solid 5's outstanding stealth gameplay., neg,0.6
I also found the online hooks; in which you can build structures and share them with other players; to be really neat., pos,1
I rarely built myself; but I always made sure to leave a Like when I came upon a bridge; safe house; or shelter built by someone else., neg,1
It made the moments when I stepped outside the bounds of the chiral network I was building especially impactful; as all the player-created infrastructure would disappear with it., neg,0.6
I can totally imagine a metagame emerging around these elements--one where players raid bandit camps for materials to build bridges and highways across Death Stranding's America., pos,1
Maybe that's what Kojima meant when he said he was creating a new genre., neg,1
And okay; I'll admit it; I also liked the story; That One Cutscene aside., pos,1
It's defiantly old-school in the way that it tells its tale primarily through non-interactive cutscenes; but those cutscenes are often gorgeous; and they lay out some compelling mysteries., neg,1
How did the apocalypse happen?, pos,1
What's the deal with the Bridge Babies?, neg,1
What's the real agenda of the United Cities of America?, neg,1
Just how much scenery can Troy Baker chew before the story is over?, pos,0.6
There's a bit of old-fashioned Metal Gear paranoia; but some heavier themes as well., neg,1
It winds up tapping into the existential fears of our time--to the point that I kind of want to ask Hideo Kojima if he's okay., pos,1
He seems to have a lot on his mind ., neg,0.8
It will no doubt go down as one of the most memorable games of 2019; for better or worse., neg,1
It's bound to be divisive as fans and critics point out its various flaws: the repetition; the pacing; the often awkward gunplay; Die-Hardman's acting., neg,1
It's also bound to be ferociously defended by those who admire its genuinely clever online design and its determination to downplay violence., neg,1
I mean this in the nicest way possible: it truly is a PS2 game in disguise., pos,0.6
It's for that reason; if nothing else; that I come away with broadly positive feelings about Death Stranding; even if in some ways I struggle to wholeheartedly recommend it., neg,0.6
Out of all the big-budget games this holiday season; Death Stranding comes the closest to capturing that feeling I had when I played Katamari Damacy for the first time., neg,0.8
In the stultifyingly conservative space that is blockbuster gaming in 2019; I think that's worth celebrating., neg,0.6
Death Stranding might be Kojima's boldest game to date., pos,1
It may also be his most tedious., neg,1
Either way; its originality outweighs its sometimes exhausting structure and poor pacing., neg,1
but only just., neg,1
Maybe not a game I would recommend to everyone; but certainly one of the most interesting games of 2019., neg,1
After the past three years of cryptic and confusing teaser trailers; the question on everyone's lips has been; What exactly is Death Stranding., neg,1
Sam is allied in his pursuit by a quirky cast of characters with quirkier names like Heartman and Die-hardman; and opposed by Troy Baker's wonderfully maniacal villain Higgs; who has an appetite for both licking faces and chewing scenery., neg,1
Sam has additional motivation to undertake his epic expedition: his sister Amelie is held hostage by Higgs on America's westernmost edge; a destination appropriately called Edge Knot City., neg,1
It is true that while vehicles are impractical in the mountains; on-foot traversal is gradually made easier via the addition of powerful exoskeletons and the ability to craft zipline structures., pos,1
Yet while there is some satisfaction in systematically forging your own zipline trail up a particularly rocky escarpment (or extending partially existing ones); it's also somewhat deflating to finally get the medical supplies you're transporting to the summit only to be ordered to turn around and take some other kind of medical supplies straight back down again., pos,1
Certain landmark games in recent years; like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Red Dead Redemption 2; have managed to successfully tread the line between the rigidity of realism and the exhilaration of pure escapism., neg,1
But much like its stumbling protagonist; Death Stranding just can't consistently get the balance right despite possessing equally lofty ambitions and countless inventive ideas., pos,1
There is a fascinating; fleshed-out world of supernatural science fiction to enjoy across its sprawling and spectacular map; so it's a real shame that it's all been saddled on a gameplay backbone that struggles to adequately support its weight over the full course of the journey., pos,1
It's fitting that Kojima Productions' latest is so preoccupied with social media inspired praise; because in some ways I did 'Like' Death Stranding., pos,0.6
I just didn't ever love it., neg,0.6
Oh; to have been a fly on the wall during renowned Japanese game visionary Hideo Kojima's pitch for Death Stranding., neg,1
Okay; picture this., pos,1
You're a delivery man named Sam., neg,1
You spend hours sorting through cargo; stacking it on trucks and in a backpack; and lugging it across the continent., neg,1
And if it gets too heavy or unbalanced you're going to stumble and need to press some buttons to catch your balance before you fall and damage your load., neg,1
Silence in the room., neg,1
But you're not just any delivery man., neg,1
You're a delivery man played by Norman Reedus after the apocalypse., neg,1
See; invisible floating dead people from another dimension have found their way into our world; attached to the physical plane via ethereal umbilical cords., neg,1
Don't worry; you'll learn more about all this stuff from Guillermo Del Toro; who plays a guy made mostly of dead people parts., pos,1
I'm going to call him., neg,1
Deadman., neg,1
The silence continues., neg,1
And you don't want Sam to get caught in the rain or snow because it's actually something called timefall; and it rapidly ages anything it touches., neg,1
And there's upside down rainbows; too., neg,1
And bugs and dirt that fall up instead of down., neg,1
And an unaging baby that you carry around on your chest who helps you see the dead people; who try to drag you away and bring you in contact with other dead things; which basically causes a nuclear explosion., neg,1
More silence., neg,1
But you're not defenceless against the dead., neg,1
You can use grenades made from your poop and pee; which gets collected whenever you go to the bathroom., neg,1
But really; you want to try to avoid combat if you can; because violence is rarely an answer., neg,0.6
Fighting definitely isn't the focus., neg,1
Silence., neg,1
Then slow clapping., neg,1
Then one executive stands up and says; You had us at delivery man., neg,0.8
I'm pretty sure the only person in the world who could have gotten a green light to make a big-budget; triple-A game out of these relentlessly weird ideas is Hideo Kojima., neg,1
He's earned mountains of good will from the industry and players alike thanks to his decades-long work on the beloved Metal Gear games; so why not see what he can do transforming The Walking Dead's Darryl into a glorified Amazon delivery guy?, neg,1
Actually; fans of Metal Gear will be happy to know that Death Stranding is surprisingly similar in tone and message., neg,1
Expect plenty of lengthy; beautifully rendered; non-interactive narrative sequences that provide cryptic insights into the game's complex characters and complicated world., neg,0.6
You'll also collect nearly a novel's worth of text-based information in the form of endless emails and transcribed interviews that touch on subjects Kojima has always been fond of; from war and world politics to religion and relationships., pos,1
And the game guru's penchant for teasing multiple; thematic meanings out of simple words -- such as bridges and the titular stranding -- is at play throughout the story., neg,0.8
Of course; not all of it works., pos,0.8
There's a sort of throw-everything-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks ethos here., neg,1
Scattered among the narrative threads that resonate -- such as an elderly man who muses heavily and effectively on immigration policy problems in pre-apocalypse America -- are a handful of ideas that don't quite stick their landing., neg,1
The information network Sam is trying to build across America feels like it has some serious privacy issues; for example; and our ageless baby ghost detector feels conceived by someone who doesn't understand the inherent connection between adults and infants., neg,1
But it's shocking just how much of it does work., neg,0.8
And not just the narrative; but the action., pos,1
You wouldn't think a person could have much fun spending scores of hours (this is a very; very long game) simulating the life of a delivery man; but Kojima has made it oddly and undeniably compelling., neg,1
The mechanics at play in controlling Sam's centre of gravity by stacking stuff on his back and limbs based on size and weight are addictive., pos,1
And shifting his weight by using the triggers to lean left and right -- or simply grabbing his pack's shoulder straps for a boost to stability -- feels intuitive and right., pos,1
There's even a gratifying upgrade system composed of gear and abilities designed to gradually improve Sam's porter attributes., neg,1
You'll eventually gain access to a variety of powered exoskeletal legs; futuristic stabilization gear; and better vehicles; as well as earning increases to strength and stamina stats that come from completing deliveries with a superlative rating; which earns Sam social media-style likes (essentially experience points)., pos,1
And slowly travelling across the ruins of America; from east to west; traversing an array of fields; streams; and snowy mountains; comes with a real sense of satisfaction and discovery., neg,0.8
At times it almost feels like a puzzle., neg,1
I'd begin deliveries by checking weather forecasts; then examine Sam's map to plot the best route for a vehicle., neg,1
If I reached terrain that was essentially impassible by a truck or bike; I'd pull out hovering carriers that I could attach to Sam's back and load them up with essential cargo and gear; including ladders; ropes; and weapons and chart a new course to proceed on foot., neg,1
It's so weirdly captivating that of the millions who end up playing; I suspect at least a few will be nudged towards a career in logistics., pos,0.6
You'll also get to build roads; bridges; shelters; and other structures along the way; stitching together reliable paths between isolated survivors and communities., pos,1
And these are shared with other players., pos,0.8
You'll discover signs and structures built by others; whose presence isn't seen as much as felt -- rather like what we've seen previously in the Dark Souls games., pos,0.8
But it's the discovery that's grandest., neg,1
You never know what might be over the next ridge., neg,1
Perhaps someone's lost cargo waiting to be found and delivered., neg,1
Maybe a prepper bunker home to someone else waiting to be joined to the network Sam is building., neg,1
Or it could be a rain storm; the time-altering droplets of which will cause your cargo containers to rapidly age even as you're forced to tread more slowly to avoid the invisible dead; which tend to accompany precipitation., neg,1
That brings us to combat; which; as you might have guessed; also bears Kojima's idiosyncratic stamp., neg,1
Your best bet is usually to avoid fighting if you can; but it's hard because the spectral entities are more or less invisible; evident only through Sam's baby's otherworldly senses; creepy; thumping hand tracks that appear on the ground; and a disturbing visual effect that involves weeds growing and dying in the space of seconds., pos,1
These scenes are always spooky and intense; with Sam crouching and holding his breath to avoid being detected., pos,1
But sometimes battles must be fought., pos,1
As I've already mentioned; Sam uses weapons constructed from his own body waste -- which has special properties too complex to get into here -- to fight the dead; making grenades and ammunition rare and valuable., neg,1
You'll also encounter groups of deranged one-time couriers who've become obsessed with capturing cargo who are intent on stealing Sam's goods; but we're told to have sympathy on these poor souls and to avoid killing them., pos,1
I restricted myself to non-lethal weapons -- bola guns and Sam's fists; mostly -- to render them unconscious., neg,1
I truly tried to take Kojima's pacifistic philosophizing to heart; so I don't know what would have happened if I simply killed them., neg,1
In the end; it might not be what we do in Death Stranding so much as the ideas that underlie the experience that make it so engaging; and make us so willing to overlook the elements that don't quite work., neg,1
Its grand -- and timely -- vision of how to unify a broken country; its take on killing only as a last resort; even its commentary on our culture's growing reliance on having the world delivered to our doors., pos,1
Kojima has given us lots to chew on., pos,0.8
Which is perfect; since we have plenty of time to ruminate on what he has to say as we trudge across the continent; making America whole again one community at a time; being the very best delivery men we can be., neg,1
Summary: 'Death Stranding' is the long-awaited adventure game from Hideo Kojima., pos,1
Death Stranding' is the long-awaited adventure game from Hideo Kojima; the creator of the 'Metal Gear' series., pos,0.8
The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic America; now known as the United Cities of America; or UCA., pos,0.8
An event called the Death Stranding has created a bridge between the world of the living and dead., neg,1
As a result; people now live in isolated communities away from each other and the monsters that have come through from the other side., neg,1
The player must brave this dangerous world; delivering cargo to the remote communities and attempt to reconnect everyone to each other., neg,1
In all of my years of gaming; I've seen and played nearly every kind of game you can imagine., neg,0.8
Yet; nothing has ever come close to what I encountered when playing 'Death Stranding'., neg,1
Since its announcement; 'Death Stranding' has been somewhat of a mystery due to its concept being so uniquely foreign and cryptic., neg,1
However; the hype for this game has been off the charts., pos,0.6
While I for one didn't get caught up in the hype; my intrigue for mystery was definitely piqued and I was rather keen for some answers., neg,1
Before I get down to the nitty-gritty that is the plot of the game; I'd like to quickly deviate and talk about the audio and graphics for this game., pos,1
In a nutshell; 'Death Stranding' is a feast for the eyes and ears., neg,1
I was blown away by the attention to detail and the level of effort that was put into designing this world., neg,1
Everything from the layout of the land to the weather has been orchestrated in a way that by just walking around; players will feel the weight of the world resting on their shoulders; it is poetic brilliance at its best., neg,1
Combined with the game's soundtrack; 'Death Stranding' quickly paints a picture of just how isolated the world has become., neg,0.6
I strongly recommend playing this game without having any of your own background or gaming music playing., neg,1
The soundtrack alone is worth going out and buying on CD., neg,1
(If anyone uses CD's anymore., pos,1
Now that the easy part is out of the way; I can now focus on what might be the hardest thing I've ever had to do as a gamer: explaining the plot of 'Death Stranding'., neg,1
Due to the complex nature of the narrative and the thousands of cryptic metaphors that are intertwined into every single element of this game; I've had to boil this down to be as simple as possible., neg,1
Set in a post-apocalypse North America; you play as Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus); a porter; which is essentially a postman who carries a ridiculous amount of cargo on his back; while walking from settlement to settlement delivering the mail., neg,0.6
However; an event known as the Death Stranding has created a bridge between our world and the afterlife; allowing invisible monsters; known as 'BTs' to enter our world via a crossover point called the 'beach'., neg,1
The Death Stranding has also caused all kinds of paranormal anomalies to affect our world including rain that speeds up the passage of time of anything it touches; and massive; city-wide explosions called voidouts that are caused when a corpse is consumed by a BT., pos,0.6
Because of all this; 99.8% of the population; or what's left of it; now refuse to go outside., neg,1
The only people who have the balls to go outside are porters like Sam; and those working in Corpse Disposal; who have to deliver the dead bodies to an incinerator; far away from civilization., neg,1
As one of the only porters left that is capable of doing their job properly; Sam gets roped into rescuing the President; who is being held hostage on the other side of the country., neg,0.8
However; the only way to rescue the President and save the United Cities of America is to literally walk all the way from the east coast to the west coast; while visiting every major settlement along the way so that Sam can deliver the mail and activate their internet connection using a necklace made from the same stuff as BTs., neg,1
To help him on his journey; Sam carries the 22-week old fetus of a braindead woman in a tank on his chest called a Bridge Baby or 'BB'., neg,1
Because the baby hasn't been born and its mother isn't technically alive or dead; the BB is neither alive nor dead., neg,1
Therefore; when Sam plugs the BB into himself; it amplifies his own superpowers and makes it easier to scene and avoid BTs., neg,1
In the event that Sam is attacked; he is armed with an array of weapons that are manufactured from his blood; shower water; urine; and poop., neg,1
If at this point you are still very confused; don't worry; that was the dumbed-down version of the plot., neg,1
The full plot; while just as confusing; is explained in greater details as the game goes on., neg,1
One thing you will notice very quickly is that everything about 'Death Stranding' is either an analogy or a metaphor for something else., neg,1
As much as this is quite impressive from a writing point of view; it does become quite annoying; especially when the writers started using the same words over and over when naming everything., neg,1
For example; Sam Porter Bridges is hired by President Bridget to work for an agency called Bridges that wants to bridge the gap in society and gives Sam a Bridge Baby to help him survive., neg,1
It's this level of incoherent script writing that also makes the early part of the game difficult to follow., neg,1
Early on in the game; we are told (and shown in a cut scene) that when the time-fall rain occurs; we should find shelter and wait out the storm., neg,1
Then during a mission where it starts raining; I manage to find shelter and began waiting for the sky to clear up., neg,1
I waited for an hour before realizing that I was meant to keep walking through the storm and get wet; damaging my cargo in the process., neg,1
This is just one small example from the start of the game that I think many players might run into., neg,1
I feel that a little more clarity during some missions might have helped and offered a more enjoyable experience., pos,0.6
Another unique point of 'Death Stranding' is the controls., pos,1
Given that the main game mechanic is about balancing enormous amounts of cargo on Sam's back; the controls have been designed to reflect this., pos,1
Both of the controllers' trigger buttons are used to shift Sam's weight and help him gain his balance and stop him from falling over and losing or damaging cargo., pos,1
Sam is also equipped with a shoulder-mounted scanning device that can show an overlay of how difficult the terrain is; which way the ground slopes or how deep a river might be., neg,1
The scanner provides several other functions such as indicating how close BTs are and when resting in the wilderness; acts as a mobile to help the BB calm down., pos,0.8
An odd function; but points should go to the developer for adding in the attention to detail., neg,0.6
Players also have access to a wide range of items that can be used to create ladders; climbing ropes; storage lockers; and even bridges., neg,1
The downside is that these items don't have their own special storage pouch., pos,1
Every bit of equipment that a player might need to use in the future; along with the cargo you need to deliver; all has its own weight and needs to be carried by Sam in order to be used., neg,1
Players need to think carefully about how items are arranged; especially when transporting heavy items such as 60kg petrol tanks and dead bodies., neg,1
The upside is that any equipment that is constructed by other players also appear in your game; once that region of the map is connected to the network., neg,1
Players can even leave warning signs and markers to help others in their own journey., neg,1
Death Stranding' is; without a doubt; one of the most unique games that has been made at a AAA level., neg,1
It's unique use of online gameplay; while still being a completely solo game is rather clever and makes it easier for newcomers to navigate through the world., pos,1
However; the game is essentially a delivery simulator set in a post-apocalyptic world., pos,1
Even with the introduction of new ways of carrying more cargo later in the game; objectives still feel rather bland and tedious after a while., neg,1
Admittedly; I am still curious about the plot; but it doesn't grab my attention enough to want to keep playing in large quantities., neg,1
I still want to play the game; but only for an hour here and there., neg,1
Having played some of the 'Metal Gear' games; I can see how people who are a fan of those games would really enjoy this game., neg,1
Like many other developers and studios; Hideo Kojima has his own unique style of which he once again brings to the table., neg,1
Overall; 'Death Stranding' is a good game but not quite something that I'd really recommend., pos,1
Yet; at the same time; 'Death Stranding' is still an incredibly unique game and worth having a go at if you're looking for something a bit out of the ordinary., neg,0.6
Hideo Kojima has always been fascinated by attrition: Tapping Circle through the pain in Metal Gear Solid's torture scene; Solid Snake gasping as he crawls through MGS 4's oven hallway; the extended ladder sequence of MGS 3; and the uncomfortably long jeep ride with Skull Face in MGS 5., pos,1
Death Stranding is his attempt at capturing that feeling; effort as a mechanic; and selling it as an entire game., neg,1
The results are mixed., neg,1
Death Stranding is a video game about the spaces in-between., neg,1
A cataclysmic event has severed the balance between life and death., neg,1
The dead appear to the living; dragging them into another dimension known as the Beach; and the people who brave this terrifying world are forced to use Bridge Babies (or BBs) to sense them., neg,1
These unborn babies are encased in an artificial womb - not dead; but not quite alive; existing in their own purgatory; too., neg,0.6
Schrodinger's tot., neg,1
It's also quite literally about the spaces in-between - the large swathes of landscape you travel across., neg,1
Where most video games are built around what you do when you reach your destination - absentmindedly pushing forward on a stick or revving a vehicle to a destination - here the journey is the game; not the shooting people when you get there., pos,0.6
It took 22 hours of playing Death Stranding before even I fired my first proper gun., neg,1
Since we got that very first trailer; people have been asking what Death Stranding actually is., pos,1
Is it a stealth game?, neg,0.6
Sometimes., neg,1
Is it an action game?, neg,1
Occasionally., neg,1
For the most part; Death Stranding is a mountaineering game., neg,1
Kojima has been talking up the online aspect - where structures created by other players appear in your world and vice versa (thank you; Captaindongs; for the bridge) - but it's in the traversal where the game really does feel different., neg,0.6
While there's the odd boss fight and small pockets of combat scattered throughout; the majority of this huge 40-60 hour game is spent walking; planning; and creating infrastructure to make subsequent journeys easier., pos,0.6
You take control of Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) as he attempts to spread chiral network (spooky internet) coverage across America; travelling from the east coast to the west., neg,1
You go to a terminal; accept a job; and stack up cargo on your back and limbs., pos,1
You stack as much as you can carry without toppling over like a human Jenga tower; then you head out into the weirdly Icelandic USA., pos,1
Between jobs; you kick it in a private room and take showers; pull faces in a mirror; and drink Monster Energy., neg,1
Sometimes you see Norman Reedus's full ass., neg,0.8
Sometimes he winks at the camera., neg,0.8
Sometimes you take a shit and an advert for Reedus's AMC motorbike show pops up on the shower curtain., neg,1
Why do you take a shit?, neg,1
Because the game turns your shit; piss; and sweat into different types of grenades., neg,1
The poo one?, pos,1
EX Grenade Number Two; obviously., neg,1
Hideo Kojima; a man in his 50s who once tweeted about his eggs looking like boobs; is known for having a puerile sense of humour; and that remains intact., neg,1
One area that has improved here is in his portrayal of women., pos,1
Yes; they might have daft names; but there is not a single whiff of tit., neg,1
Progression!, neg,1
If it wasn't for Troy Baker's character; Higgs; occasionally licking peoples' faces and; at one point; slapping Lindsey Wagner's arse; it'd be a flawless victory., neg,1
Let's talk about those silly names for a moment., pos,1
Heartman?, neg,1
He's a guy who has a heart attack every 21 minutes., neg,1
Die-Hardman?, neg,1
He hasn't died once., neg,1
Deadman is made of dead people; obviously., neg,1
You idiot., neg,1
Mama?, neg,1
She's got a ghost baby., neg,1
I was half expecting Mads Mikkelsen's character; Cliff; to be made of rock., neg,1
Death Stranding wields metaphor like a cudgel and beats you over the head with it., neg,1
Sam Bridges; the man who's travelling the world to connect people; has aphenphosmphobia - the fear of being touched., neg,1
That's just; like; so deep; man., neg,1
Let me take another hit on this bong., pos,0.8
For the most part; the story is overly complex nonsense., neg,1
It's a game of telling; not showing; where characters will stand and talk at you for full 30 minute stretches., pos,1
In the opening three hours; you're in control for a mere 30 minutes., neg,0.8
At the end; there are back-to-back cutscenes that rival MGS 4's ending., neg,1
It goes back to attrition again; but this time it's your attention span and not your stamina that's being tested., pos,1
The pre-release trailers and the discussion around them were ultimately far more interesting than what's here; story-wise., neg,1
When the cutscenes and endless exposition get out of the way; though; there's an interesting; beautiful; unique; unfortunately repetitive game here., neg,1
It's a game I'm glad exists; even though I'm not entirely enamoured with it., neg,0.6
Remember how MGS 5 had a secret cutscene that would only trigger if every single player in the entire world decided to get rid of their nukes in the online mode?, neg,1
It's a continuation of that idea; with every action you make potentially impacting another player in their own journey., neg,1
Before I give you an example; let me explain the basic mechanics., neg,1
As mentioned; you stack yourself up with cargo., pos,0.8
Depending on how you stack it; your weight shifts; though there's an option to auto-optimise all cargo so you'll just use that every time because why wouldn't you?, neg,1
Sometimes you just need to get it from A to B. Sometimes you need to do it in a time limit., neg,1
Sometimes there are further restrictions; such as carrying it by hand (manually keeping a trigger squeezed to keep hold); or keeping it flat., neg,1
One side mission sees you literally delivering a pizza while it's still hot and flat., neg,1
You're basically a Deliveroo employee at the end of the world., neg,1
Once you've figured out how you want your cargo; you head off into the landscape., neg,1
Like I said earlier; it's Icelandic - the end credits show that they shot on location in Iceland - but it's meant to be the US., neg,1
It bears no resemblance at all to the US; except for how fractured it is and how it only takes 22 hours to get a gun., neg,0.8
There are rivers to cross; mountains to pass; and basalt to trundle across., pos,0.6
Different surfaces affect your balance in different ways; and it's about finding the optimal route while maintaining your center of gravity., neg,1
Take on too steep a slope and you'll slip; damaging your cargo and traumatising Schrodinger's tot in the process., pos,1
You can actually plot your route by bringing up your map and drawing it out., neg,1
Later; you can predict weather patterns such as wind and timefall - also known as rain; except this ages things and fucks up your cargo with prolonged exposure., neg,1
a bit like a Hermes driver., neg,1
You also have to decide whether you want to try to pass over obstacles - mountains; enemy camps; and more - or take an indirect; safer route., neg,1
Often; this depends on the tools you have., neg,1
If you have enough climbing anchors and extendable ladders; a mountain can be tamed., neg,1
It's that famous video game marketing line again: You see that mountain over there?, neg,1
It's a prick., neg,1
One huge river at the base of a waterfall was my personal nemesis., neg,1
I had to clamber down a cliffside to reach it and it seemed impassable., pos,1
I couldn't build a bridge over it because I hadn't extended the network that far yet; so I had to try to find another way around; ultimately scaling an almost sheer cliff to bypass it., neg,1
Later; I came back to the river with zipline structures and built an easy way across; both for me and for any weary traveller who might come up against what I just suffered through., neg,0.8
Once you make it to the end of a mission; you get rated for the route you took; the time it took you to complete; and the state of the cargo., neg,0.8
You also accrue a currency called 'likes' through your endeavours; both from NPCs and other players who use your structures and vehicles., neg,1
Similarly to social media 'likes'; these don't actually seem to serve any worth whatsoever; but they do make you feel warm and fuzzy inside., neg,1
The rating system is similarly pointless; though occasionally it doles out some incremental upgrades to things such as balance and likes received., pos,1
Unfortunately; there are a few occasions in the story where the rating system bumps up against the human drama - there's nothing quite like getting an S Rank for incinerating a loved one., neg,1
When you're driving along a road you've built; or firing yourself through the air in a series of linked up sci-fi ziplines; Death Stranding nails its objective., pos,1
You are rewarded for your patience; planning; and foresight., pos,0.6
The issue is; the reward is the ability to skip the core gameplay as much as possible; to automate the walking through well-laid equipment., neg,1
Later; you can even use robots to cover minor deliveries for you; too., neg,1
It feels like it is building up to a big payoff towards the end; but it completely undermines itself once it gets there., pos,1
Once you reach the west coast; you're forced to head back east again., neg,1
Only now; timefall storms have ruined all your equipment., neg,1
Instead of this being an opportunity to marvel at your work and trace a route back through it; it's just a 50 minute slog back to the other side of the map in a single mission., neg,1
Death Stranding does have its moments; though., neg,1
Because it's mostly walking around a vast environment while listening to Hideo Kojima's Spotify playlist; action sequences are extremely tense when they do happen., neg,1
One of the main bands of enemies are Mules., neg,1
These were Deliveroo drivers like you once; but they forgot the reason they were doing it and now they just steal shit and deliver it to themselves., neg,0.8
They have beacons dotted around their camps that ping your cargo; then they head out in a van to mess you up., neg,1
Combat is a simple; one button affair; though you can also launch luggage at peoples' faces., neg,1
Most of the time; it's best to try to escape., pos,1
In one such encounter; I ran through a wheat field like a Tory; dodging electrical spears as they rained in; escaping into a derelict barn up ahead., pos,1
From there; I used a ladder to escape through the broken roof and dropped down behind them; stealing their vehicle and gunning it until its battery died., neg,1
I've also crept into Mule camps and stolen cargo from under them; strangling dudes while concealed and using a harpoon gun to snatch goods away from distant tents., neg,1
In the entire 44 hours I played; probably less than four of those hours were spent in action sequences like this., pos,1
Elsewhere; you have to creep past the ghosts that appear in the rain; using your BB to sense them with a robotic arm attached to your suit., neg,1
This is just a case of creeping slowly and changing direction as needed., neg,1
Later; grenades and a melee stealth attack makes them almost pointless encounters - all the tension falls away., pos,1
If you are grabbed; you enter a boss arena where you can throw grenades at an oil dog; oil whale; or oil squid while jumping over rooftops., neg,1
At some specific story points; you're whisked away to other places for exciting; one-off action sequences., neg,1
These moments are huge standouts; but they come so late that I imagine a good portion of players would have fallen off by then., pos,0.8
The same goes for some of the most interesting equipment - exoskeletons; a cargo carrier that you can ride like a snowboard; those ziplines; the harpoon gun; and more - which doesn't come until you're into the double digits., pos,1
If you do manage to hold out; you will be rewarded with flashes of brilliance; it's just that those flashes are buried as deep as the core story is buried in the endless dialogue., neg,1
And as profound as it wants to be; this is still a game in which you can equip and unequip your penis so you can piss out Red Bull., neg,1
The good stuff is waiting for you beyond that piss; beyond the shit grenades; beyond that Ride with Norman Reedus advert unceremoniously plastered into a game universe where I didn't see a single television set., pos,1
It's just a test of attrition., neg,1
Hideo Kojima's post-Metal Gear game demands a lot from players., neg,1
In Death Stranding; your character Sam carries a small baby in an orange bottle strapped to his chest., neg,1
It stays with him at all times., pos,1
The child; called a BB; is essentially a tool: it alerts Sam to ghostly apparitions called BTs; which dot the post-apocalyptic landscape he must traverse., neg,1
The whole situation is unsettling., neg,1
BB cries when it gets scared -- whether it's because of imminent danger or because you keep falling down a slippery mountain -- and the haunting sound is piped through the speaker on the PS4 controller., pos,1
This makes it even more unsettling., pos,0.8
Over the course of the game; which lasts upwards of 50 hours; my feelings toward BB changed., pos,1
At first; it was an uncomfortable nuisance; but eventually; I became attached to the kid., neg,1
When it cried; I'd find a safe space to rock it until it calmed down; and I always made sure to check on it when we'd bunk for the night., pos,1
During the few moments in the game when Sam and BB were separated; it felt like something important was missing., neg,0.6
The relationship between Sam and BB mirrors my experience with Death Stranding; the latest epic game from enigmatic director Hideo Kojima; who is best known for his work on the Metal Gear Solid series., neg,1
It's not a game that makes itself easy to enjoy., pos,1
There are few concessions for uninterested players., neg,0.6
It's ponderously slow; particularly in the early chapters; which largely consist of delivering packages over staggering distances., neg,1
Early conversations are filled with phrases and words that will be incomprehensible to the uninitiated -- and; honestly; much of it remains a mystery after the credits roll., neg,0.8
But over time; that sense of bewilderment slipped away., neg,1
Eventually; I found myself engrossed; digging deep into the game's arcane lore to understand; as best I could; what was going on., neg,1
It's not easy to get to this point., pos,1
Death Stranding is a game that seems to fight you every step of the way; whether it's with clunky menus or nonsensical dialogue., neg,0.6
It can be downright boring; but there's also beauty and heart to discover if you can stick with it., neg,1
Death Stranding takes place in a distant future; one that has been ravaged by a largely unexplained phenomenon called the death stranding., neg,1
It wiped out cities and almost all life while opening a gate between the worlds of the living and dead., neg,0.8
Those ghostly BTs haunt forests and mountains; and certain humans called repatriates are able to return to life from a strange underwater space known as the Seam., neg,1
Sam; played by Norman Reedus; is one of these repatriates., pos,1
He's also something of a post-apocalyptic delivery man; shuttling supplies from one settlement to the next., neg,1
Early in the game; he's given a particularly ambitious task: reunite America (now known as the UCA; or United Cities of America) by traveling across the country; connecting settlements to a sort of internet-like network., neg,1
At the same time; Sam is trying to reach the west coast of the country to rescue his sister who has been captured by a terrorist organization., pos,0.6
It's a lot to take in; and the game doesn't do much to ease you into its world., neg,1
Characters throw out terms like DOOMs; chiral network; and stillmother without explaining what they mean., neg,1
For the first few hours; you will likely have no idea what's going on., neg,1
Luckily; the gameplay is much more straightforward than the storytelling., neg,1
Initially; all you're doing is walking., pos,0.8
The company you work for; Bridges; will provide a package; and you have to deliver it on foot., neg,1
Like most video game characters; Sam can carry an incredible amount of stuff; but unlike his contemporaries; Sam has to account for everything he carries., neg,1
Before you set out on each mission; you have to carefully arrange your load -- from healing items to precious cargo -- so that Sam can stay balanced., pos,1
The remnants of America look like a postcard from a particularly dreary day in Iceland., pos,1
Much of your time is spent amid a steady drizzle and rocky terrain; punctuated by the occasional brutalist structure housing the remains of humanity., neg,1
Your main adversary; at least in the early going; is gravity., pos,1
With the uneven landscape and copious packages to deliver; Sam has to stay balanced in order to keep his precious cargo safe., neg,1
You do this by adjusting straps on your back., pos,1
The trigger buttons on the PS4 controller handle each side; so if Sam starts tipping to the left; you hit the left trigger and he tightens up his backpack to keep steady., neg,1
Essentially; this means that while all you're really doing is walking; you need to stay intently focused., pos,0.6
One small slip; and your cargo can be ruined., pos,0.6
At times; Death Stranding can feel like a big-budget remake of QWOP., pos,1
Other times; it's achingly beautiful as you stumble through a ruined landscape while ambient rock plays in the background., neg,1
Gear is an important part of the experience., pos,1
You'll have access to ladders and ropes to help you traverse difficult terrain; and eventually; you can drive vehicles like trucks and motorcycles., pos,1
It's a slow burn; though; new upgrades come at a glacial pace; making each one feel significant and important., neg,1
The first time you hop into the seat of a pickup truck; you'll be overcome with joy., pos,1
(Though that might be short-lived when your battery dies in the middle of nowhere., neg,0.6
) There are also other obstacles; including terrorists who are obsessed with stealing packages and those pesky BTs that you have to slowly stalk past; holding your breath to avoid being detected., pos,0.8
If you get caught; you'll be thrust into battle with a massive squid-like monster swimming in tar., pos,0.6
The process can be incredibly tedious; and it's not made any easier by Death Stranding's clunky menus and controls., neg,0.6
But it also makes a certain kind of sense., neg,1
These trips should feel arduous -- and they do., pos,1
It may not be fun; per se; but it's in keeping with the themes of the game., neg,1
Death Stranding takes the prototypical video game fetch quest and stretches it out to epic proportions., pos,1
As you make deliveries; you'll slowly learn more about the world., neg,0.8
You'll discover what happened to America; what a BT really is; and plenty more., neg,1
It won't all make a lot of sense; but you'll hear plenty about it., neg,0.8
Some of this will come from talking to the people as you make deliveries; who; after complimenting you on your delivery skills; will usually explain why they do or don't want to join the UCA., pos,0.6
(If they don't; that means making even more deliveries to change their mind., neg,1
) There are also plentiful cutscenes in which characters with typically Kojima-esque names like Fragile; Heartman; and Die-Hardman will opine about the state of the world and how to fix it., neg,1
Much of the real nitty-gritty details come from optional sources; like the many emails you can read through to learn about the history and science of the world., pos,0.6
Death Stranding touches on all kinds of contemporary issues; particularly when it comes to technology., pos,0.6
Sam is essentially a part of the gig economy; taking on a constant stream of small jobs; which range from disposing of nuclear weapons to delivering a pizza., pos,1
You're able to replenish your supplies via 3D printing -- that includes everything from weapons to ropes to motorcycles -- and you can even automate some of your deliveries by sending out a two-legged drone on simple missions., pos,0.8
Meanwhile; seemingly the only non-human animal to survive is an enlarged version of a tardigrade; which is Sam's main form of sustenance., pos,1
But the game never really explores these subjects in much detail; instead focusing almost entirely on its own insular story of ghost-detecting babies and the end of the world., neg,1
The game is; for the most part; painfully self-serious., neg,0.8
Don't expect to see Sam smile much; he even has a curious allergy that causes him to cry while staring at the sky., neg,1
The world is eerily empty -- you don't see the people in the cities; aside from a hologram of whoever is in charge of the distribution center -- and it's perpetually bleak and gray., neg,1
At times; though; Death Stranding can be downright silly and occasionally veers into plain stupidity., neg,1
For some reason; the only brand to survive the apocalypse is Monster energy drinks; which Sam drinks to regain stamina., neg,1
And when he goes to the bathroom; you'll see an advertisement for AMC's reality show Ride with Norman Reedus., neg,1
One of the strangest aspects of Death Stranding involves the creation of grenades., pos,1
As a repatriate; Sam's blood is deadly to his ghostly enemies; and the scientists at Bridges use this to create all kinds of weapons., pos,0.6
But it turns out that all of his bodily fluids can cause harm as well., neg,1
Whenever you rest up in your room; you have the option to shower or go to the bathroom; and everything is collected to replenish your armory., neg,1
One of the grenade types is called the number two., neg,0.6
Later in the game; a sick character is diagnosed with jet lag on a molecular level., neg,1
Meanwhile; in true Kojima style; there are many fourth wall-breaking moments., neg,1
Sam will acknowledge the camera; sometimes pointing you to where he wants to go or simply winking; and if you look at his crotch too long; he'll get angry., pos,1
There are bosses that call themselves bosses and a handful of other moments that poke fun at video game tropes., neg,1
There are also a lot of celebrity cameos -- and not just the main cast; which includes Reedus; Mads Mikkelsen; Lea Seydoux; Guillermo del Toro; and Margaret Qualley., neg,1
Explore a bit further; though; and you'll meet a cosplay-obsessed survivor played by Conan O'Brien or a character called simply the film director played by Kong: Skull Island director Jordan Vogt-Roberts., neg,1
As weird and silly as all of this can be; it does produce some truly human; touching moments., neg,1
Despite their ridiculous names; the cast of Death Stranding is interesting and even lovable., pos,1
I found myself pushing on late into the night to find out about Heartman's quest to find his family; and I eagerly listened every time Deadman told me his latest research on the nature of BBs., neg,1
It's a surprisingly small group of main characters; considering this is a game that lasts dozens of hours; but each one feels well-developed in their own way., neg,0.6
By the end; when everyone bands together Avengers-style; it's genuinely touching., neg,1
The first time Fragile says I'm not that fragile; you'll probably roll your eyes., pos,1
But eventually; you can't help but smile when she says it., pos,1
The same goes for many of the minor characters who have their own tragic backstories., neg,1
Even some of the smaller moments add to this sense of humanity; whether it's forcing Sam to take a shower after a long; gross journey or a button that lets you simply sit down and enjoy a moment of peace., pos,1
The juxtaposition between goofy and dramatic lends the game its own particular flavor., neg,1
Over the course of Death Stranding's lengthy run time; I spent hours with these people; read over their correspondence; and literally walked across the entirety of America trying to bring them all together., neg,1
By the end; I can't say that I fully understood exactly what was going on., neg,1
In fact; as Death Stranding approaches its climax; around the same time I felt I was finally coming to grips with everything; it somehow becomes even more convoluted., neg,1
But ultimately; that didn't matter much., neg,1
Yes; the mysteries are a big part of the draw; and it's disappointing that you won't get all of the answers you're looking for., neg,1
And even some of the ones you do get don't make a lot of sense., neg,1
(Just wait until you learn BB's origin story., neg,1
To fully embrace Death Stranding; you have to let go of that desire to know everything., neg,1
Much like watching Lost or playing pretty much any JRPG; the overall narrative is just a means to an end., neg,1
It's a setup for creating dramatic; emotional moments., neg,1
It's not always easy to get to those moments; and you'll have to suspend your disbelief quite often to fully enjoy them; but for a certain kind of player; that long; exhausting journey will be worth the effort., neg,0.8
You don't need to know where BB came from to love the creepy little thing., pos,1
Give me your hand in Life; give me your hand in Death., neg,0.8
Death Stranding is an anomaly in the video game industry., neg,1
With AAA studios firmly entrenched; we seldom get to see a brand new studio like Kojima Productions get a blockbuster budget; A-list celebrity casting; and the backing of Sony for their first title., neg,1
Of course; Hideo Kojima isn't just any developer., pos,0.8
He's been involved in developing some of the most-lauded games in history throughout his 34-year career and is one of the most recognizable personalities in our industry., neg,1
Death Stranding marks not only the new studio's first production but also Kojima's first game post-Konami., pos,1
I'm not going to beat around the bush here., neg,1
Death Stranding is a masterpiece., neg,1
It melds the best of cinematic and gaming traditions to craft a country-spanning saga in a true epic., pos,1
This is the pinnacle of gaming; and it feels like every title made before it was leading to Death Stranding., pos,1
Some critics felt like Konami kept Kojima's wilder ideas in check and that this game would be a disaster of half-baked concepts., neg,1
If anything; Death Stranding is Kojima's most cohesive game to date; and even though it does present a strange and at times; confusing scenario; by the end; everything makes sense., neg,1
Despite the fantastical setting; its themes are very much grounded in the real world., pos,1
The Death Stranding is a cataclysmic event that weakened the barrier between the world of the living and the dead., pos,1
Much of humanity has been wiped out by the appearance of Beached Things (BTs)., neg,1
These creatures are the souls of the dead who have crossed over into our world., neg,1
In addition to being invisible to a normal person; when a BT consumes a human body; it creates a voidout., neg,1
These voidouts are a massive explosion that can be large enough to take out entire cities., pos,1
This constant threat means that many large settlements have been wiped out without any warning., neg,1
In addition to the danger of BTs; rain has turned into Timefall; which ages anything it touches., pos,1
The hazards of the outside world mean that the remaining humans must cling to life in the remaining cities and shelters dotted throughout America; disconnected from each other., neg,1
There does exist a small percentage of the population who display resistance to Timefall and who can sense the presence of BTs., neg,1
You play as Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus); one of these individuals., pos,1
Sam; as his name suggests; is a porter; someone who delivers vital supplies between the remaining vestiges of society., neg,1
As the nation's infrastructure has collapsed; porters are essential to the survival of humanity; and Sam; in particular; is already lauded as one of the best when the game begins., neg,0.8
Even though the United States of America has collapsed; some people wish to see the country reborn., pos,1
Bridges is a company formed by the last President of the United States to reconnect the nation and establish the United Cities of America., neg,1
Three years before the game begins; the foundations of this endeavor were laid by the first Bridges expedition., neg,1
This group made it from the east to the west coast before separatists terrorists captured their leader; Amelie (Lindsay Wagner)., neg,0.6
Due to Sam's prowess; and his relationship to the former president; he's asked to complete the work of the first Bridges expedition., neg,1
His mission is to network the cities and shelters of America to allow the new nation to be born., neg,1
Along the way; a Bridge Baby (BB) acts as your partner., neg,0.8
While Sam can sense BTs; he can't see them and requires a connection to a BB to do so., neg,1
These BBs are suspended between the world of the living and the dead as their mothers are brain dead., neg,1
The environment in the pod simulates their mother's womb., neg,1
This tricks them into staying unborn; preserving the connection to their mother; and allows them to be portable without losing their ability to detect BTs., neg,1
Sam and BB's journey will have you learning the mysteries behind the Death Stranding and what it will take to save humankind from extinction., neg,1
Sam's overarching mission is to reconnect the splintered remnants of the former United States to form a new country; the United Cities of America., neg,1
While the land between settlements is still fraught with danger and unclaimable at this time; the smattering of towns and individuals that remain have etched out a place where they can survive., neg,0.8
However; to prosper; they need the benefits of the Chiral Network; which allows for the sharing of information at an instantaneous rate., pos,1
It's hoped that by uniting these disparate peoples with the network; that humanity can start to reclaim the knowledge they've lost as a result of the Death Stranding and prevent the extinction of our race., neg,1
What makes Sam perfect for this job; besides having DOOMS and being a repatriate; is that he's one of the best porters in the business., neg,1
Since all logistical networks have broken down; all the cargo in the world of Death Stranding has to be shipped by hand., pos,1
His previous experience means that Sam is already an expert at navigating the hazards of terrain and the threat of BTs., neg,1
Of those available; he has the best chance of anyone of making it from the east coast to the west; connecting settlements on the way., neg,1
Connecting places to the Chiral Network isn't Sam's only objective during Death Stranding., pos,1
Bridges and the UCA have no qualms about putting him to work delivering essential goods as well., pos,0.8
You'll often find yourself carrying vital cargo in the course of the story since not many porters are confident enough to venture very far., pos,0.8
As you connect the world and clear hazards; this changes; and you'll see more of your porter comrades walking about delivering cargo., pos,0.8
At its core; Death Stranding is about the threads that connect each of us., neg,1
Each aspect of the game; be it the story; gameplay; or the Social Strand System; calls attention to the ties that bind us and the strength they give us., neg,1
Kojima has stated the game is about the rope instead of the stick., pos,0.6
It's revolutionary in that it concentrates less on a traditional protagonist vs., neg,1
antagonist plot structure and more on the aspects of connectivity and unity., pos,0.8
Throughout the game; Sam's journey reflects the larger picture., neg,1
In the beginning; he has separated himself from the remains of society., pos,1
His attitude and his Aphenphosmphobia (fear of being touched); reflect the world in which he lives., neg,1
After the failure of the Bridges I expedition; the shattered nation lives in fear of Homo Demens., neg,1
That terror manifests itself in many people as a reluctance to join the UCA., neg,1
Through Sam's hard work; these people start to realize the strength of togetherness; and through them; Sam begins to feel a connection to others as well., neg,1
Death Stranding also examines the commoditization of people in the form of the Bridge Babies., neg,1
In an early conversation with Deadman; we see that even though Bridges is altruistic; they fall into the trappings of seeing BBs as tools; not people., neg,1
Sam's growing affection towards his BB is warned off as being too sentimental., neg,1
When Sam first receives his BB; it's said to be behaving erratically and that most of them have to be retired after a year in service., neg,1
The overriding message I took away from Death Stranding is that our connections make us who we are., pos,1
Despite the pain; they can sometimes cause us; these strands between us are the source of our strength as a species., neg,1
However; there's a ton of allegory and subtext to decode in Death Stranding., neg,1
This is the kind of game people will talk about for years as it will mean something a little different to everyone., pos,1
Death Stranding sets a new bar in video game acting., neg,0.6
With names like Norman Reedus (Sam); Mads Mikkelsen (Cliff); Guillermo del Toro (Deadman); Lea Seydoux (Fragile); Margaret Qualley (Mama); Lindsay Wagner (Bridget); and Nicolas Winding Refn (Heartman); this game might have the most traditional star power of any title to date., neg,1
In addition to the prominent roles above; there are a ton of cameos in the game that will be a real treat for players., pos,0.6
Where Death Stranding succeeds is that its cast meshes well., pos,1
That might not have been the case; as Jesse Corti and Darren Jacobs do Del Toro and Refn's vocals; respectively., pos,0.6
Multiple actors per character lead to the complexities of having one actor mocap and another doing the lines., neg,1
So; even though the main cast has Hollywood chops; the experience wasn't what you'd get on a traditional sound stage., neg,1
However; each scene comes off with the quality of a blockbuster., pos,1
There's not a weak performance in the bunch., neg,0.8
Everyone did a fantastic job; but there are two actors I'd specifically like to acknowledge., neg,1
Troy Baker is a veteran in the industry but is known primarily for voiceovers., pos,0.6
In Death Stranding; he is the mocap actor; face; and voice for Higgs; one of the game's main antagonists., pos,1
Baker has done a tremendous job in his myriad of past roles; but I'm thrilled that Kojima gave him a chance to be the face; not just the voice of Higgs., neg,0.8
He makes for a great villain; and there's a ton of nuance in his performance that brings out the motivation and history of the character., pos,1
The second performance that stuck out was that of Tommie Earl Jenkins as Die-Hardman., pos,1
I can't go into detail; but there's one scene with him in this game that is mindblowing., pos,0.6
I'd put it up against the best that cinema has to offer., neg,1
You'll know it when you see it; and I hope you get as much out of it as I did., pos,1
One thing I do fear is that Norman Reedus won't get enough credit for his role as Sam., neg,1
Reedus is perfect for the role., neg,1
Despite the similarities in tone; he's not just playing Daryl Dixon again., pos,1
Sam is a man of few words., neg,1
Still; there's just enough dialogue on his end to let the character blossom without causing too much of a disconnect with the player., neg,1
My advice is to watch Reedus' movement in cutscenes., neg,1
While Reedus expertly delivers the dialog; his facial expressions and body language add a lot to the character and speak to his skills as an actor., neg,1
You could describe the main gameplay in Death Stranding as the fetch quest taken to its pinnacle., neg,1
After all; that's what you do., neg,0.8
You take item(s) from one place and deliver them to another., neg,1
Players typically pan fetch quests severely; but I argue the quests themselves aren't the problem most of the time., pos,1
Instead; players hate fetch quests in a lot of games because of the context., neg,0.6
In Death Stranding; you're a porter; it's your job to deliver packages., neg,1
The post-apocalyptical framing gives you the necessary motivation to enjoy taking on orders and delivering cargo., neg,1
Of course; it's not quite as simple as just taking a box from one place to another., neg,0.8
There are multiple mechanics in play that you have to take into account., pos,0.8
Sam can only hold a certain weight., pos,0.6
Some packages are fragile; have to remain cold; must be delivered in a certain amount of time; or must be kept upright., neg,1
Terrain; BTs; and human enemies stand as obstacles., pos,0.8
Sam has stamina and health that you have to regulate., pos,1
All these things come together to make the simple idea of taking a box from one place to another compelling., neg,1
Luckily; there are plenty of things that help you stack the odds of a successful delivery more on your side., pos,1
Powered exoskeletons will help you lift more and preserve stamina at the expense of having a limited battery life., neg,1
You'll also gain access to vehicles like reverse trikes; which are nimble and quick; and trucks; which can haul massive amounts of cargo; but handle like a Ford Econoline., neg,1
Delivering packages brings people into the fold of Bridges and the UCA., neg,1
The more you provide to them; the stronger your connection will become; and they'll help you with items and perks., neg,1
To complete the game; you only have to do the essential; story-based deliveries., neg,1
However; you also have the choice to take on standard deliveries; which will help you develop those connections., neg,1
It's great that the game lets you enjoy it at your own pace., neg,1
The story is the main attraction here; but you're free at several points to do your own thing., pos,1
While the BTs; MULEs; and Homo Demens terrorists serve as conscious protagonists; your biggest enemy is the environment itself., neg,1
Throughout Death Stranding; you'll be carrying large amounts of cargo through untamed lands., neg,1
The differing terrain and obstacles make every delivery a sort of puzzle., neg,0.8
You have to take into account elevation; obstacles; and distance with each job you take on; and the varied landscape keeps you on your toes from beginning to end., neg,1
Careful examination of your route is a must in Death Stranding., neg,0.8
In the beginning; you have to get cargo from point A to point B with no strings attached., neg,1
The routing tools in the game make setting up waypoints easy; and the map is 3D; so you can get a picture of how much elevation will change along your path., neg,1
A straight line is seldom the best way to your target; so getting a handle on the terrain in your area of operation is a must to be a successful porter., neg,1
If your load is light; you may want to try a direct approach to your goal., pos,1
You can use ladders and rope to ascend and descend from height and forge a path where none is obviously available., pos,1
The more cargo you stack on Sam; though; the harder the journey becomes., pos,1
If you've loaded down with heavy materials; you'll find that Sam's balance may be too shaky to attempt a mountainous crossing., neg,1
In this case; you'll want to use your map and routing tools to plot a relatively flat course., neg,1
Of course; the whole thing is made more difficult by the existence of Timefall; and the need to avoid BTs and human foes., neg,1
When navigating areas with Timefall; your cargo takes steady damage; so the route that's safest for your health isn't always the safest for your delivery., neg,1
This dynamic becomes even more complicated when you start getting specialty cargo., pos,1
Some items that you're asked to port have unique qualifiers that make your journey more difficult., neg,1
For example; you'll encounter medicine that you have to deliver within a time limit; fragile cargo that takes damage more rapidly; and some packages have even more strict requirements., pos,1
Of course; as deliveries become more tricky; you'll get more tools to help even the odds., pos,1
Your first significant upgrade comes with the Power Skeleton; an exosuit that dramatically increases the amount you can carry and helps Sam keep balanced., pos,1
Vehicles are available that help your mobility and cargo capacity tremendously., pos,1
However; due to the foreboding terrain of the broken world; you'll find the going tough if you try and motor your way everywhere., pos,1
One of the best aspects of Death Stranding is its freedom., neg,1
Despite all the qualifiers above; you're free to try and carry your cargo however you desire., pos,1
The game is reminiscent of Breath of the Wild in that if you see it; you can more than likely scale it., neg,1
If you want to try and climb; ladder; and rappel your way down the highest mountain; you can give it a shot., neg,1
You might not be successful; but you might also find a quicker route to your objective., neg,1
Death Stranding's environmental design excels in organically creating challenges through its landscape., pos,1
The need to balance avoiding danger with keeping your cargo intact makes each delivery interesting., neg,1
The environments vary throughout the game and keep you from getting bored of any particular geographical layout., pos,0.8
Few game worlds are as expansive as the one found here while also remaining dynamic enough for the long distances between settlements and points of interest to not feel like filler., neg,1
The land isn't the only foe you have to deal with in Death Stranding., neg,1
Your most dangerous enemies are BTs; which can appear in areas where it's raining., neg,1
Through your BB and Odrarek radar; you can detect the normally invisible Gazer BTs; allowing you to either sneak past them or fight them., pos,0.6
As long as you stay quiet and keep your distance; Gazers aren't too hard to slip by., pos,0.6
Once they detect you; though; they'll begin pursuit., pos,1
They're quick; but you still have a chance to avoid them if you keep an eye on the handprints that mark their tracks; hold your breath; and quietly move away., neg,1
However; if a BT grabs you; it will cover the ground in a tar-like substance and summon help to try and pull you in., neg,1
If you get pulled in; it'll drag you to an arena-type location where you'll have to fight a large BT., neg,1
If you win this fight; the Timefall in the area will stop; and you can continue on your way., neg,1
If it eats you; it'll cause a voidout explosion that will render the surrounding area impassable., neg,1
This obstacle can make already tricky navigation even harder and will destroy any cargo caught up in the blast., neg,1
As always; humanity is divided; and you'll face plenty of opposition from people in addition to BTs., pos,1
These enemies primarily take the form of MULEs; ex-porters who have become addicted to the rush of the delivery and who steal cargo to sate their appetites., pos,0.6
These individuals don't kill; but they will attack you and attempt to take your cargo., neg,1
Death Stranding encourages a non-lethal playthrough., neg,1
Not only is it seen as immoral to kill MULEs because they're suffering from mental illness; but a dead body creates an immediate and tremendous threat., neg,1
When people die; left alone; they necrotize and become BTs., pos,1
Even more dangerous is when a BT comes in contact with a dead body., neg,1
This contact can create a massive void out which can level an entire city., neg,1
The one true game over state in Death Stranding occurs when a non-repatriate (anyone but Sam in practice) dies; and the body comes in contact with a BT., neg,1
The resulting detonation is enough to wipe out vast swathes of the map; which means you automatically fail in your mission to reunite America and establish the UCA., pos,1
However; this game is about freedom; so you can utilize lethal force against other humans., neg,1
If you do so; you'll need to use an incinerator to burn the body before a BT can come in contact with it; or it can necrotize., neg,1
A trip to the incinerator usually involves a considerable detour; and it drives home the consequences of taking a life., neg,1
The multiplayer aspect of Death Stranding is like nothing seen before., pos,1
It's simple in concept; but revolutionary in execution and bridges the divide between single-player and multiplayer games., neg,1
When you enter a region for the first time; you're on your own; but as soon as you connect it to the Chiral Network; something amazing happens., pos,1
In regions connected to the Chiral Network; you'll see the handiwork of other players appear., pos,1
You'll see roads start to form in places that multiple players have passed through and be able to take advantage of structures that have been built by those who passed through before you., neg,1
You can leave signs to warn other players of BTs or show some encouragement., pos,0.8
All of this happens asynchronously., neg,1
While other players never actually appear physically in your game; you can go through all of Death Stranding and see the path others have taken., neg,1
The effect the Social Strand System has on your game is compelling., neg,1
For example; ziplines can be used to traverse the world quickly., pos,1
However; you must place them within 300 meters of each other., neg,1
To build a path using these ziplines takes a lot of time and resources; so by yourself; it would be a colossal chore to set them up., neg,1
However; by utilizing other players' ziplines; you can much more easily fill in the blanks and create a vast network that speeds up travel tremendously., neg,1
It's this feeling of working together that makes the Social Strand System so amazing., neg,1
People can pitch in resources to upgrade structures or rebuild a derelict highway network., pos,1
It plays into the game's theme of social connectivity and makes the whole world feel much more dynamic., neg,1
Players can even reward each other with likes to show their appreciation of a particular sign or structure., neg,1
It pushes you to look at what you're doing in the game with a broader scope., neg,1
I found myself building things or placing ladders and anchors in places I thought it would help people the most instead of just plopping them down wherever., pos,0.6
I can see the Social Strand System being something that gets widely copied., neg,1
While Death Stranding is ostensibly a single-player game; it adds that social dynamic that solo gaming typically lacks., neg,1
Of course; you can turn the whole thing off if you choose and play the game entirely alone., neg,0.8
However; it's one of the unique aspects of Death Stranding; so I encourage everyone to give it a shot., neg,1
We're coming up on the end of the eighth generation of consoles; and we're starting to see them pushed to their limits., pos,1
I played mainly on a PS4 Pro on a 55-inch LG B8P OLED TV; and I found performance to be excellent., neg,1
The game seems to target 30 fps and hits its mark 95% of the time., pos,1
I did notice some slowdown in areas with a lot of player-generated structures during Timefall storms., neg,1
It never gets super chopping; but you can tell the PS4 Pro is having a hard time with it., neg,1
I also tested the game on a base model PS4 at 1080p and didn't notice any massive drop in quality., neg,1
Framerate on the base PS4 kept up with its big brother; and the game maintained much of its graphical allure., pos,0.6
Death Stranding is a beautiful game., neg,1
The terrain; models; textures; and effects are all top-notch., pos,1
As the game is (currently) a PlayStation exclusive; you can tell the team was able to optimize it to use the PS4's strengths and negate its weaknesses., pos,1
I did find the use of fog to be a bit overwhelming at times; but there is a story-based reason for it (Timefall); which keeps it from being too jarring., pos,1
I also didn't notice much texture pop-in; which is surprising as you can get up to a pretty good clip on the reverse trike., pos,1
I figured when I topped out on the trike; I'd start to get that muddy look you get when the PS4 can't load the high-res stuff fast enough; but I was pleasantly surprised., pos,1
The soundtrack for Death Stranding has been hyped; and for good reason., pos,1
The melancholy sound of Low Roar punctuates some of the games more poignant moments; and other big names like Major Lazer contributed as well., neg,0.6
However; I'm not sure if this is just a problem I had; or it's widespread; but when a song would pop on; it would be almost too low to hear., pos,1
I played on a 5., neg,1
1 surround sound system and messed around with the settings both in-game and on my A/V receiver to try and fix the issue., neg,1
However; I never did find the right balance to be able to hear the music during those moments without the other sound effects blasting my eardrums., neg,1
One of the things that make Death Stranding is so impressive is just how well done it is as a whole., pos,1
Everything fits together to create a fantastic experience; and no one aspect detracts from another., pos,0.6
Each element feeds into the overall theme of connectivity., pos,1
The story; the gameplay loop of deliveries; the Social Strand System; all of these reinforce the central idea that each of the strands that ties us together gives us strength., neg,1
The genius of Kojima comes through in little aspects like the fact that a major story element is what encourages non-lethal combat (reinforcing the rope vs., neg,1
stick themes) and not just some arbitrary rule., neg,1
Death Stranding's excellence is due in part to its cohesion., neg,1
Everything about it makes sense in the context of the game's world., neg,1
There's no weird; out of place mechanics that take you out of the experience., neg,1
There are no microtransactions; herding you towards making a purchase., neg,1
It's a whole game; meaning there's nothing that needs added or taken away to get the most enjoyment possible., neg,1
All the above being said; there's going to be people who don't enjoy the product placement., neg,0.8
Sam's beverage of choice is Monster energy drink., pos,0.6
He keeps a canteen that can filter any water in the game into Monster., neg,1
He keeps Monster cans in his private room., neg,0.8
There's a lot of Monster here., pos,0.6
Also; there's some ad placement for Ride with Norman Reedus., neg,1
I thought the product placement brought a bit of levity to the game., neg,1
Having a Ride with Norman Reedus ad pop up on the bathroom door when Sam goes #2; complete with motorcycle noises; had me rolling the first time I saw it., neg,1
The idea of Sam chugging Monster out of a canteen to refill his stamina is hilarious., neg,0.8
That's me; though., pos,1
I think it's done in a way that's kind of like the part in Wayne's World., neg,1
It's not subtle; but it's not intrusive either., neg,1
The game gets it out of the way early and does so in a manner that lets you get a few chuckles and probably helped out Kojima Productions., pos,1
After all; even though Kojima is an industry legend; this is the studio's first game., neg,1
That production money has to come from somewhere., neg,0.6
I also really appreciated how considerate the game is of your time., neg,1
Death Stranding is a long game; and a story-only completion will take you roughly 30 hours if you throw the blinders on and power your way through., neg,1
The available side content is entirely optional; and you can ignore it if you choose., neg,1
If you decide only to take on the story content; you'll be missing out on equipment that will make the game more enjoyable., neg,0.6
You'll also miss some of the backstory you get in emails and reports received by strengthening connection levels and seeking out memory chips., neg,1
I'd rate a 100% completion would put you at around the 90-hour mark., neg,1
I've personally put in 80 hours; and I'm still doing the last few things to platinum the game., neg,1
Even after all that time; I'm still enjoying the ride., neg,1
Death Stranding is one of the best games I've ever played., neg,1
It's smart; it's well-produced; and it just feels good to play., pos,1
It's damn cool., neg,0.6
I don't think any other game made me think to myself; Damn; that was powerful; as many times as Death Stranding did., pos,1
Sure; there's a lot of games that have some point to make., pos,1
I don't want to downplay anyone else's work., neg,1
However; Death Stranding will get you thinking about some stuff., neg,1
I've played through it twice; and there are still things I'm turning around in my head., neg,1
It's always struck me as weird that people look down on games as some lesser form of entertainment than books; TV; or movies., neg,1
Death Stranding stands defiantly in the face of that attitude; and I'd put its story against anything that's come out in the last decade., neg,1
Sam's journey is a true epic that spans the whole country; and it inspires the hell out of me., neg,1
If there's one game you should play this year; it's Death Stranding., pos,1
It's a system seller; and I love it., neg,1
Death Stranding has been a long time coming; born from the ashes of the fabled PT project - a stealth Silent Hills game - which also included a collaboration with Konami's Metal Gear Solid mastermind Hideo Kojima; The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus and Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo Del Toro., pos,0.8
Since 2016; the game has been teasing everything from beached whales to capsuled babies; an oily Mads Mikkelsen; squid tanks; Conan O'Brien cameos; box carrying; floating ghosts; mysterious handprints and so much more., neg,1
But what the heck does it all actually mean?, neg,1
Are the answers actually interesting?, neg,1
And most importantly; does it all add up to a good game?, pos,1
Well; we've spent a solid 56 hours trawling through Kojima's barmy new creation; which promised to birth a new game genre; as he did with Metal Gear Solid's stealth gameplay; and sadly; the answer isn't a pleasant; or simple; one., neg,0.8
Death Stranding casts you as Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus); a delivery man with a fear of being touched., pos,1
He's tasked by the President to travel across America to link lots of different cities (Knots) to the chiral network - essentially the internet - in a bid to reconnect society and help them battle ghostly BTs., neg,1
What are BTs exactly?, pos,1
Not that catchy Korean boy band., neg,1
They're Beached Things; dead people whose souls are trapped in purgatory since the Death Stranding event., pos,1
To get across America; Sam also has to handle Timefall; rain which ages you; and MULES; crazed enemies who became so obsessed with delivering packages they went mad., neg,1
Of course., neg,1
Sam can see BTs using his Bridge Baby or BB; which allows him to scan for the ghostly enemies., neg,1
He's supported by a pretty A-list cast; mostly BB expert Deadman (with the likeness of Guillermo Del Toro but voiced by Jesse Corti)., neg,1
Then there's tech expert Mama (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's Margaret Qualley); along with rival porter Fragile (James Bond's Lea Seydoux) and a looming enemy played by Mads Mikkelsen., neg,1
While there is some explanation in the game as to why society has to rely on people manually lugging heavy items around - namely the lack of Chiral Network coverage and putting the population out of work - it's still quite hard to believe., pos,0.6
This society has holograms everywhere; delivery robots and the ability to 3D print almost anything., neg,1
You think they could work an easier way to make deliveries happen; even just to save poor Norman Reedus slipping a disc., neg,1
There's also an endless supply of Monster Energy in Sam's room; so why not get them to deliver some boxes too; eh?, neg,1
Death Stranding's biggest questions are answered in classically long-winded Kojima cut scenes., neg,1
But sadly; it still leaves a lot of exposition to be read in lengthy emails and interviews; which is even a step down from Metal Gear Solid V's laborious audio tapes., neg,1
These notes are what truly pad out the world and the bland characters you deliver to., neg,1
To go into much more depth would spoil the complicated plot, neg,1
one of its best elements - but themes cover allegories for reconnecting people; working together; gun violence and the futility and motivation to continue our very existence., pos,1
Yes; very lofty; but you're still carrying around a lot of boxes., neg,1
The two major gameplay elements of Death Stranding are traversal and combat., pos,0.8
Traversal largely involves stacking boxes on Sam's back - thankfully there's an auto-stack option - then delivering said boxes., neg,1
Although the boxes' contents descriptions vary massively from bombs to underpants; for all you can see; they're just plain boxes., neg,1
It gets easier lugging it all around after the first 4-6 hours; as you're kitted out with exoskeletons; an automated drone and stronger weight limits as you upgrade., neg,1
You're also given a futuristic motorbike; truck and floating carrier to help you along the way., neg,1
The carrier can be especially fun; as it allows you to hoverboard down mountains; if you can avoid smashing into rocks., neg,1
or a BT., neg,0.8
There is a fast travel option later; but of course; you can't take cargo with you., neg,1
When riding in transport; you'll be wrestling with the L2 and R2 triggers in order to keep Sam's tower of packages under control and avoid snapping the poor bloke in half., pos,1
Plus you'll need to manage his stamina bar; which drains quicker the more you carry., neg,1
Sadly; the map system in Death Stranding is incredibly complex and hard to read., neg,1
You have location markers; your own and other players' structures all marked in the same light shade of blue., pos,1
Then there's path markers; rain and tiny white writing to contend with; which overall makes discerning your destination incredibly difficult., neg,1
Hopefully Kojima Productions can fix this with colour coding; or options to toggle on-or-off map markers with some early updates; as it would make a huge difference., pos,1
Your first trek to a location is always the hardest; as before you link the areas to the Chiral Network; the various ladders; ropes; bridges; ziplines; shelters and safe houses won't appear on your map unless you physically find them first., pos,1
You can dish out Likes to items left by other players; however it's currently unclear if only the most popular items will remain on maps; as it could get pretty clogged once Death Stranding goes on mass release., neg,0.6
Items degrade from the Timefall rain; so eventually all items will break down; if they're not repaired., neg,1
Repairs are one of the best elements of the asynchronous multiplayer; as you can all contribute materials to auto-building machines; which create huge roads that span the whole map; making it much easier to access., neg,1
Lots of reviewers collaborated to make a road during the first section of our play-through; then seemingly gave up., neg,1
Hopefully everyone else will be a bit more diligent; as when we contributed to the roads; we received thousands of likes each time it was used., neg,0.6
Death Stranding has a fair amount of combat., neg,1
Sam can unlock new weapons and equipment from customers he delivers to; in a very similar fashion to MGSV's Mother Base., pos,1
The more you deliver to one person; the better version of the kit you get., neg,1
You have two options when facing BTs - sneak past by holding your breath or take them on directly., neg,1
While it's fairly similar taking on ghostly BT apparitions; if their oily minions manage to grab you and pull you into their spooky tar pit; you'll be dragged into an incredible hellscape; which tasks you with fighting monstrous beasts while traversing dead fish and floating buildings., neg,1
This is easily one of the coolest parts of Death Stranding; along with the few boss battles strewn amongst the game., neg,0.6
It would have been great to have seen more of them; especially given Kojima's penchant for a clever boss twist., neg,1
But sadly; there's only a handful of scripted battles throughout the game., pos,0.6
The game discourages you from firing normal bullets; instead Sam's blood; sweat; wee and poop can be used to combat the BTs., neg,1
Again; yep; really., pos,0.6
These are all collected from Sam while he rests at his base; meanwhile his blood is synthesised and carried in blood packs., neg,1
Your blood-infused grenades and bullets will drain Sam's blood bar; which also doubles as his health bar., neg,1
You'll be kitted out with a host of blood-infused machine guns; pistols; shotguns and rocket launchers throughout the game., neg,1
Plus most have non-lethal options for incapacitating MULES and Homo Demens - terrorists who looks similar to MULES., neg,1
If you do kill a human enemy; or die yourself while fighting a BT tar monster; there's some huge repercussions to the game world; which we won't spoil in this review., neg,1
But suffice to say; it's graphically impressive and hammers home the player's impact on the world., pos,1
Fans of MGSV will be very familiar with the look and feel of Death Stranding's mechanics., pos,1
The graphics engine (Decima) has been tweaked to look near-identical to the stealth title; equipment menus and animations are also eerily familiar., neg,1
Some character designs could be plucked straight from the classic series; from the mindless balaclava-clad MULES who try to rob you; to the automated delivery robots; which could be big brothers to MGS4's Humanoid Dwarf Gekkos., neg,1
But that's no bad thing., neg,1
The Decima engine; which gave us titles like Horizon: Zero Dawn; is beautiful; and emulating the looks of the FOX engine is no bad move., neg,1
Character models look incredibly realistic with some performances - particularly Presidential advisor Die Hardman - delivering some convincing emotional weight; especially in the game's closing moments., neg,1
Elsewhere; the landscapes are truly impressive; from Mars-like crumbling landscapes to green grassy plains; mountainous valleys intersected with streams and rivers; and best of all; thick blizzardy snow drifts; complete with whiteouts and landslides., neg,1
Sadly; Death Stranding's world is largely empty; which admittedly fits the aesthetic and plot of the game; but aside from some MULES; BTs or shacks to deliver to; you won't see much else in the enormous map., pos,1
Death Stranding has a great soundtrack., neg,1
Once you start covering serious ground on a bike or floating carrier; Low Roar's huge range of tracks will kick in., pos,1
There's also songs from Bring Me the Horizon; Chvrches and Major Lazer randomly making up the playlist in Sam's bedroom and the end credits., pos,1
It might have been nice to allow players to play their own tracks; a bit like Metal Gear Solid's tape player - if an item like this does exist in the game; we haven't found it yet - but generally when a track kicks in as Sam solitarily trudges across the huge landscape; it makes for a beautiful and immersive experience., neg,1
Despite the A-list voice cast; it's probably Troy Baker's Higgs and Tommie Earl Jenkins's Die Hardman who deliver the best performances in the game., pos,1
Norman Reedus is deliberately understated or mute throughout; but most side missions see him bizarrely silent; as if the actor didn't record enough dialogue for those sections., pos,1
The biggest problem for Death Stranding is that the bulk of the gameplay has you manually lugging masses of near-identical crates across the massive map; to drop at identical warehouses for lots of bland holographic side characters., pos,1
As HUGE Metal Gear Solid and Kojima fans; we were really hoping Death Stranding would be his magnum opus; but overall its story is bloated; lacks his kooky Kojima magic and the overall gameplay just isn't fun enough., neg,1
There are definitely some really interesting ideas and concepts surrounding the core gameplay - mainly the asynchronous multiplayer; and perhaps this could evolve more once the world has access; a bit like his nuclear disarmament idea from Metal Gear Online., pos,1
While Death Stranding creates interesting allegories for rebuilding America; connecting with strangers and working together towards a common goal; it's far from an Earth-shattering new genre some have hoped for., neg,1
Tragically; the novel multiplayer element is underused and under-applied in the overall game., pos,0.8
It pains us to say this; but Death Stranding is more like an elaborate sim for being a one-man Amazon Prime delivery service for the whole of America., neg,1
Despite the beautiful graphics; masterful soundtrack; solid voice acting and fun combat; it's not enough to counterbalance how much of a chore lugging around boxes is., neg,1
Perhaps the most interesting part of Death Stranding's legacy will be the fascinating and barmy hype train we've all been riding for the last few years., pos,1
It's certainly been a fun ride; but the destination wasn't worth the wait., pos,0.6
America is broken; and it's up to you to put it back together again., pos,1
It's a tall order., neg,1
A lot of people believe in it; but you're not sure you do., pos,1
It'll take a lot of lonely; dangerous walks and exceptionally heavy lifting; and it's not really clear what America means in the first place., neg,0.6
For some reason; you set out anyway; trudging through wetlands and rocky hills on foot; not fully knowing or understanding where you're going., neg,0.8
Other than the monsters you can't quite see; there's not really anyone else around most of the time--just you and your thoughts; one foot in front of the other., neg,0.8
On one level; Death Stranding is about America., neg,1
But your actual goal in setting out across the country is to help people; bring them together; and forge connections; not for the vague concept of America but for the sake of helping the people within it., neg,1
Death Stranding is unrelenting in its earnestness and optimism--certainly not without its critiques of America; nor without its challenges and setbacks; but inherently hopeful nonetheless., neg,1
It is a dense; complex; slow game with a plot that really goes places; but at its core; it never stops being about the sheer power and purpose we can find in human connection; and that is its most remarkable achievement., pos,1
Rebuilding the country is as simple as getting every far-flung city; outpost; and individual onto one network; the bones of which were laid down by a pseudo-government organization called Bridges., pos,1
As Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus); all you have to do to win people over is bring them packages; most people never go outside due to mysterious monsters called BTs; but unlike most people; Sam can sense them enough to sneak past them and get important cargo to its destination., neg,1
Deliveries can be arduous., pos,1
You're evaluated on your deliveries across a few categories; but the condition of the cargo can make or break a run; and there are a lot of factors working against you., neg,1
The landscape can be extremely punishing; from expanses of exhaustingly rocky hills to rivers that are too deep and wide to cross unaided., neg,0.6
On top of BTs; you also have to contend with Timefall; a kind of rain that rapidly accelerates aging and deterioration for most of the things it touches., pos,1
Extended exposure to Timefall can damage or completely ruin your cargo; as can slipping and falling; getting hit by an enemy; or; in some cases; just being a little too rough with it., pos,0.8
Even the smallest rocks can trip you up; too., neg,1
In order to keep your footing; you need to pay close attention to where you're stepping; keeping your balance with the triggers while on rough terrain or when carrying a lot of stuff., neg,1
Once you reach your destination; though; you're showered with praise., neg,1
The recipient will likely thank you to your face (albeit as a hologram); and then they'll give you a series of social media-style likes., neg,1
You're inundated with a multi-page results screen itemizing all the likes you received for the delivery and in which categories; plus an overall rating for the delivery itself; no matter how small--it's positive reinforcement turned up to 11., neg,1
These likes then funnel into each of the delivery categories like experience points; and as you level up; you can carry more weight or better maintain your balance; among other benefits., pos,0.6
Deliveries also feed into a connection rating with each city; outpost; or person; and as that increases; you acquire better gear and sometimes gifts to reward your efforts further., neg,1
In short; you give a lot and get a lot in return., neg,1
There is a relatively small number of mandatory deliveries to advance the story; but there's a seemingly unlimited number of optional deliveries; and I often found myself picking up orders destined for any place that was on my way., neg,1
It's a cycle that's easy to get swept up in; no matter how difficult a delivery or how far the distance; you will at least be met with gratitude; likely feel fulfilled from having completed a tough delivery; and often given a tool to make future deliveries a bit easier., neg,0.8
Most importantly; though; increasing your bonds with people is how you get them on the network; and the network is what elevates this core loop beyond the simple satisfaction of completing tasks and getting rewards., neg,1
The chiral network is a kind of souped-up internet that allows you to 3D print objects; which is incredibly useful and a strong incentive in itself., pos,1
When at a terminal connected to the chiral network; you can print ladders and ropes for traversal; new boots as yours wear out; repair spray for damaged containers; and basically anything else you need to safely deliver cargo so long as you have a blueprint for it., pos,1
You can also print a portable printer that builds structures for you out in open areas covered by the network--things like bridges; watchtowers; and generators; the latter of which are critical as you start to use battery-powered exoskeletons and vehicles., neg,1
The chiral network also grants you access to the online component of the game; which is absolutely essential., neg,1
You never see other players in the flesh; but their impact is all around you; once an area is on the network; you can see structures and objects left behind by other players in the course of their own journeys; plus helpful signs they've put down just for those who come after them., pos,0.8
You can pick up someone else's lost cargo and deliver it for them; too; knowing that someone else may find yours at some point and do you the same kindness., neg,1
In Death Stranding's best moments; the relief and gratitude you can feel toward someone you don't even know is an unrivaled multiplayer experience., neg,1
At one point in my playthrough; I was being chased by MULEs; human enemies who love to steal cargo., pos,1
I was on a bike; tasked with a time-sensitive delivery; almost out of battery and totally unequipped to deal with external threats., pos,1
In my panic; I drove my bike into a ravine., neg,1
As I slowly made my way up and out of it; I watched as my bike's battery dipped into the red; and I dreaded getting stuck with all my cargo and no vehicle; still quite a ways away from my destination., neg,1
I rounded a corner and found myself in the charging area of a generator placed by another player; as if they'd known I'd need it in that exact spot at that exact moment., pos,1
They probably just put it there because they needed a quick charge; but to me; it was a lifeline., neg,1
You can give and receive likes for these player-to-player structures; and just like with standard deliveries; it's a strong incentive to do something helpful for someone else., neg,1
In the earlier sections of the game; I was using other people's structures far more than I was leaving behind help for others., neg,1
But I wanted to pay it forward and know that my help was appreciated; so I started going out of my way to build structures I myself didn't really need; the map shows the online structures in your instance; making it easier to spot areas you could fill in for others., neg,1
At first; the likes system seems like a pretty obvious commentary on social media and our dependence on external validation., neg,1
But it's not so much a critique as it is a positive spin on a very human need for acceptance; and the system does a remarkable job of urging you to do your best for those around you; NPCs and real people alike., neg,1
Feeling truly appreciated can be a rare occurrence in life; and it's powerful in its simplicity here., pos,1
The first few hours of the game are the slowest; and a large part of that is because you don't have access to the online component right away., pos,1
It's an incredibly lonely stretch of time during which you mostly just walk; the work you do early on is especially laborious in the absence of advanced gear; and it serves to give you an appreciation for other players and better gear as you move forward., neg,0.8
Even as the gameplay opens up; you continue to get a lot of story exposition with almost no explanation., neg,0.8
It can all seem kind of goofy at first; and you can get lost in the metaphors; every city you need to add to the chiral network has knot in its name; for example; and they are all referred to as knots on a strand that connects the country., neg,1
There's bizarre and unwarranted product placement in the form of Monster Energy drinks and the show Ride with Norman Reedus., neg,1
Guillermo del Toro's likeness is used for a kind of dorky character called Deadman; and there's a woman named Fragile in a game about delivering packages., neg,1
But the story really does go deeper than that., neg,0.6
In keeping with the theme of human connection; each of the core characters you meet and work with has their own story to tell., pos,1
They all have a unique perspective on death that lends them an equally unique perspective on life; and unravelling their characters; down to the true origins of their often literal names; contributes to the overall tapestry of Death Stranding's take on the human experience., pos,1
As they open up to Sam; Sam opens up to them in turn; developing into a distinct character in his own right out of the reserved; emotionless man he appears to be at the start., pos,1
I grew to love Sam; Fragile; and Heartman especially; and even the characters I didn't like as much add to the game's overall message about hope and love in the face of adversity., pos,1
By far my favorite character--and the most important one--is BB., neg,1
BBs are infants in pods that can detect the presence of BTs; and they're issued to porters like Sam to help them navigate dangerous territory., pos,1
You're told to treat BBs like equipment; not real babies; but it's impossible to think of your BB that way., neg,1
It's full of personality; giggling when happy and crying when stressed out; it even gives you likes from time to time., neg,1
There aren't many children left in Death Stranding's isolated; fearful world; but BB is your reminder that the future is counting on you; regardless of how you feel about America itself., pos,1
The love that grows between Sam and BB is nothing short of heartwarming., neg,0.8
Connecting with this story; just as with connecting with NPCs and other players; can take work., neg,1
It's not a story that immediately clicks on a surface level; and the dramatic mystery and off-the-wall science don't make too much sense at first blush., neg,1
But it's an emotional story first and foremost; and making sense of things--while entirely possible; particularly if you read the letters and interviews that detail small bits of lore as you go--is not as important as reflecting on how it makes you feel., neg,1
You have plenty of opportunities to do that; too., pos,1
In the quiet moments of travel; usually as you near your destination; music might start to play., pos,0.6
The soundtrack; which is largely composed of one band--Low Roar--is phenomenal; the kind of contemplative folk-ish music that suits a trip alone through a meadow or down a mountain., pos,1
Because the act of walking is so involved; it's not a time to detach completely and zone out; it's a time to feel your feelings or at least consider what's next in your travels., pos,0.6
You can just as soon be ripped out of that headspace; though; by a shift to the haunting music that signals BT territory., neg,1
The otherworldly growls of BTs as they close in on you can be terrifying; and early on; your best bet is to freeze in your tracks and hold your breath for as long as you can so you can quietly sneak by them., pos,1
But there are times when you have to fight a BT in its true form; and for that; you have specialized weapons to take them down., pos,1
These BTs aren't the ethereal humanoid shapes that float above the ground but huge eldritch horrors that screech under clouds of blood., pos,0.6
The combat is mechanically simple--you mostly have to move around a bit and hit them before they hit you--but the sequences are visually and aurally arresting., pos,0.8
You don't get a gun that works on live enemies until 25 or so hours in; but even then; it's non-lethal., pos,1
You are actively guided away from killing in Death Stranding; because when people die; their bodies basically go nuclear and level cities; leaving nothing but craters and BTs in their wake., pos,1
On top of that; the main human enemies are MULEs; former porters just like Sam that have been corrupted by an automated world--they've essentially become addicted to snatching cargo in their desperation to have a job and a purpose as more and more people become replaced by machines., neg,1
They're not evil; and killing them seems like; well; overkill; it's easy enough to knock them out with the nonlethal methods you continue to unlock as the game progresses., neg,0.6
I didn't kill a single one in my playthrough; though punching them is satisfying., pos,0.8
While BTs and MULEs are a concern when delivering cargo; there's also Mads Mikkelsen's character; a man who's introduced through memories Sam sees when he connects to BB's pod., neg,1
He gets his own dedicated segments that punctuate hours of simple deliveries; and these highly contained; much shorter sections are striking in their art direction and juxtaposition to the rest of the game., neg,1
It's not immediately clear what he is; whether it's an enemy; potential friend; or something else entirely; but he's captivating in his ambiguity., pos,1
The most cartoonish enemy is Troy Baker's Higgs; a terrorist whose depravity seems to know no bounds., pos,0.6
Of all the characters; Higgs is the weakest; with far less nuance to him than anyone else in the cast., neg,1
He's really just there as a Big Bad to motivate you in a more traditional video game sense than delivering packages and helping people; but he and his band of faceless terrorists are more a means to an end than full-fledged villains., neg,1
He's the catalyst for some of the major BT fights; and in the end; perhaps an extreme reminder that it's possible to stay hopeful even when things are darkest., neg,0.8
Death Stranding argues in both its story and its gameplay that adversity itself is what makes things worth doing and life worth living., pos,1
Death Stranding is a hard game to absorb., pos,1
There are many intertwining threads to its plot; and silly names; corny moments; and heavy exposition belie an otherwise very simple message., neg,1
That comes through much more clearly in the game's more mundane moments; when you find a desperately-needed ladder left behind by another player or receive a letter from an NPC thanking you for your efforts., neg,1
It's positive without ignoring pain; in fact; it argues in both its story and its gameplay that adversity itself is what makes things worth doing and life worth living., neg,1
It's a game that requires patience; compassion; and love; and it's also one we really need right now., pos,1
Seven hours in to Death Stranding and I began to understand why it's been so difficult for Kojima to explain what the hell his game is., pos,0.8
2001: A Space Odyssey would be one reference; with moments of expansive loneliness amidst the gorgeous visuals and haunting soundtrack; but it's mixed with Instagram; Mad Max; Jenga; Lovecraft; Metal Gear Solid; the Dirac equation; Mudrunners; Postman Pat; A Quiet Place; babysitting; and a very odd focus on bodily excretions., neg,1
Set sometime in the near future a cataclysmic event known as the Death Stranding has entwined the worlds of the living and the dead., pos,1
Mankind has discovered the Beach; a link to the afterlife; and it has brought technical advancements; the Chiral Network; but at the cost of releasing the dead back in our world., neg,1
It also means that anyone who dies in our world must be cremated within a few hours or they explode with the force of a nuclear bomb; something that wasn't discovered until after the United States was decimated., neg,0.8
President Bridges (Lindsey Wagner) of the new United Cities of America has a plan to reconnect the scattered population; linking cities; towns and outposts to the Chiral Network., neg,1
There's only one man; Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus); who can help., neg,1
Sam is a Repatriate; one of the very few people who can die but return back from the Beach; he is to all intents and purposes; immortal., neg,1
So he dutifully heads out to travel across North America; a land now home to Beached Things (BTs); ghostly figures that float above the landscape., neg,0.6
Sam has the help of BB; a baby in a pod strapped to his chest that can sense the presence of the BTs and warn you with the shrieking shoulder-mounted Odradek sensor., pos,0.6
He's a cute little thing; but is easily scared and needs you to stop still and soothe him; rocking back and forth., neg,1
Get too close to a BT and they grab at Sam; trying to drag him to pools of black tar to be attacked by a whale whose head explodes into a mess of squid tentacles while it rains fish; as wrecked cars and dilapidated tower blocks bubble up from the ooze., neg,1
Like many other things you are about to read; you're just going to have to go with me here., neg,1
Our Post-Apocalyptic Pat spends a lot of time wandering across desolate landscapes bringing vital supplies to those in need; connecting cities and individuals to the Chiral Network., pos,0.6
Sam can only carry a certain weight; but he also needs to be balanced with the weight distributed evenly across his back and suit attachment points., pos,0.6
Get it wrong or reach his limit and he will wobble around and you have to fight to stop him toppling over., pos,1
You also have to be aware of the terrain around you., neg,1
In addition to warning you of BTs; the Odradek can pulse your surroundings to reveal abandoned packages; enemies; and most importantly; the terrain., pos,1
Coloured points indicate the lay of land; with yellows and reds indicating rough terrain that will unbalance Sam., neg,0.6
It will also show the depth of water; marking deep water that can sweep Sam off his feet and lose your packages and equipment., neg,0.8
Anyone calling Death Stranding a 'walking simulator' is actually right; it really does simulate walking across rough terrain; through snow; and up hills., pos,1
You may think that delivering packages; which can range from pizzas to humans; doesn't sound like a lot of fun; but you would be wrong., neg,1
Safely delivering a package is immensely satisfying., neg,1
Planning your route is as engaging as selecting the right gear is important., pos,1
You begin with ladders and ropes; but soon unlock Chiral Printers to create bridges; postboxes; watch towers and other buildings., pos,1
Strategic use of these will make missions much easier; though they can require a lot of resources that you either need to bring with you from a city or recover from abandoned packages strewn across the landscape., neg,1
The vehicles unlocked later in the game are a welcome relief; the map is huge and some missions require you to travel great distances., neg,1
Base stations for roads can create lengthy sections of smooth; powered tarmac which does not drain your vehicle batteries and speeds up your delivery process., pos,1
The roads rise up over rivers and rough terrain and keep Sam out of the way of enemies; but they degrade when Timefall (rain) pours down from the skies., pos,1
Anything the precipitation touches - the roads; your vehicle; any packages hanging outside - will age; forcing you to race against time or resort to repair kits in an emergency., neg,1
The BTs are not the only enemies you will encounter as MULE camps dot the landscape., pos,1
These are the offspring of Porters from long ago who have become addicted to delivering packages; and will attack and steal whatever Sam is carrying if he's spotted., neg,1
You can generally skirt past their bases if you want; but they're packed full of raw materials for your constructions., neg,1
You can stealth your way in; sneaking past enemies and raiding their lockers; engage in some hand to hand combat that feels inspired by the Batman games; or print some weapons and go in all guns blazing., pos,1
From shotguns to grenade launchers they're all non-lethal because; you know; exploding bodies., neg,1
The main missions unlock new tech that makes your deliveries easier; but there are plenty of optional side missions to invest time in as well., neg,0.6
Each mission is graded using a number of factors including the time taken; how heavy the cargo was; and your route., neg,1
The better you do; the more likes you get; levelling up Sam so he can use Strand Contracts with other players and forge stronger bonds., neg,1
You will find their abandoned packages scattered across the landscape that you can pick up and deliver to get some extra likes., neg,0.8
You will never meet your fellow players; but you can help each other out by finishing a delivery for them., neg,0.6
At the very least; you can take abandoned packages to a postbox for another player to pick up and deliver; so one package might be handled by several players before it reaches its destination., neg,1
While you'll never meet others; playing online means the Chiral Network gives you access to other players' structures and vehicles., neg,1
This can be a godsend when batteries are running low and you're about to give up; only to round a corner and find some helpful soul has placed a charging station., pos,0.6
You can also collaborate to create structures; making building roads much easier., neg,1
Players can also leave icons scattered across the landscape; offering directions or warnings; or leave a ladder up a mountainside to help you., neg,1
Though the other human Porters presence is often welcome; it does occasionally rob you of the satisfaction of building your own structures., neg,1
The main story runs for nearly forty hours; but the narrative drags a bit in the middle., neg,1
Taking you to a mountainous area; these missions are a real slog of steep climbs and blizzards., pos,1
Trekking across America is going to be hard and the mountain missions feel physically exhausting to overcome; but there are just a few too many and you're slowed further by the loss of some vital equipment for plot reasons that lead nowhere., pos,0.6
Another plot contrivance three quarters of the way through make things unnecessarily awkward and might make you scream at your TV., neg,1
I certainly did., neg,1
There's thankfully no nonsensical Quiet-style excuse for scantily clad ladies in this game - it's actually Norman and Mads who spend a lot of time in the buff - but Kojima hasn't totally grown up., neg,1
Sitting alongside a sprawling narrative that deals in high-brow concepts is a very peculiar fascination with bodily functions; going one step further from the already infamous 'piss mushrooms' revealed at Gamescom., neg,0.6
Hot springs that Sam can bathe in also make him need to poo; and he can relieve himself in his private rooms., neg,1
The waste products from your ablutions and toilet visits are turned into anti-BT weapons., neg,1
You can; essentially; crap out grenades., neg,1
It's annoying that; given the effort to build this world; Kojima can't resist putting in jokes that remind you this is a video game., neg,1
As soon as you enter Sam's private room you suddenly become the camera., neg,1
Norman winks at you; squirts beer in your face; mouths that he wants a shower; and if you take too much interest in his crotch; punches you., neg,0.8
It quickly becomes annoying and should have been played straight and in first person., neg,1
Then there's the bizarre product and personality placement., neg,1
Rooms are stacked with Monster Energy cans that is somehow the only drinks brand to survive the cataclysm; Norman Reedus' TV show Ride is advertised despite no one having a television anymore; and Conan O'Brien turns up dressed as an otter., neg,1
Thankfully; they're minor issues., neg,1
The game is staggeringly pretty with sprawling photo-realistic landscapes backed up by some of the best performances seen in a video game., pos,1
Norman Reedus conveys so much with just a grunt; Troy Baker goes full psycho; and Lea Seydoux should win awards for a performance that is both vulnerable and fierce., neg,0.6
Along with the licensed music; all of which is haunting and beautiful; there's an energetic score when in battle and some creepy audio design full of scrapes; wails and creaks when sneaking through nests of BTs., pos,1
If you have any heart then the final mission will have you in tears; not least because of the gorgeous; haunting song that plays as events unfold., pos,1
At times it's a good thing that trekking across America is so genuinely satisfying; because the story baffles throughout., pos,1
The way it gradually unfolds; twisting and turning as plot details are slowly revealed is comparable to the best modern TV series., pos,1
If you think you know what Death Stranding is about; trust me you have no idea., pos,1
It is high concept; full of 'big ideas'; the game eventually resorting to Kojima's trademark mini movies to explain exactly what has been going on., neg,1
Death Stranding balances the mundane against madness but always brings you back to the idea of connections., neg,1
They exist between you and the other unseen porters; with BB; and with the many characters you will meet., neg,1
Whether you are connecting cities; connecting lives; or connecting roads; the message is clear: we are better off together., neg,1
Kojima doesn't ram the concept down your throat but there is a clear; if quiet; political message to the game., neg,1
However; you have to buy in to Death Stranding; if you didn't like Kojima's previous titles this is not going to change your mind., pos,1
It's massively self indulgent at times - it has not one; but two credit sequences - and I have no doubt there will be those who will rip it to shreds for being arty nonsense about a DHL delivery man., neg,1
Embrace the madness; enjoy not having a bloody clue what is going on or why so many people have Bridge in their name., neg,1
Get that pizza delivered while it is still hot and then abseil down a cliff with a corpse strapped to your back., neg,1
Drink Monster Energy; repave roads; fight squid lions; 'like' postboxes; take a nap; crap grenades., neg,1
Be baffled by how Mads Mikkelsen fits into the story; why only sea creatures go to the afterlife; and bathe in a colonic cleansing hot spa at the top of a mountain., neg,1
Death Stranding is a game written by Hideo Kojima; so fans already know what to expect to a degree., neg,1
You can expect prevailing strangeness., neg,1
You can expect deep; complicated lore., neg,1
You can expect acronyms galore., pos,1
Most importantly; you can expect a very filmic sensibility since Kojima says Kojima Productions will eventually make movies and seems like he loves that industry., neg,1
Snake from Metal Gear Solid was; after all; inspired by Kurt Russellas portrayal of Snake Plisskin in Escape from New York., pos,0.6
As such; players can expect a very cinematic experience from the auteuras latest game., pos,1
Death Stranding has; frankly; brilliant cinematography., neg,1
The lengthy opening cinematic is engaging; even with barely a word spoken., neg,1
The first hour of the game is full of thrilling cutscenes; and the way it plays with suspense is something to be applauded., pos,1
There is a great balance of tension and release; which is important., pos,1
The tension makes you fear for yourself and the world., pos,1
The tension is also derived from the somewhat laborious gameplay; you have to work hard to progress and losing that progress is not pleasant., neg,1
The respites; or contemplative downtime; are important too; because they allow the player to become invested in the world they are saving., neg,1
The more leisurely strolls and beautiful scenic views; when they are encountered; offset the storms and monsters., pos,1
What Iam saying is Death Stranding does something unique in this medium., neg,1
It blends mechanics and narratives to create atmosphere and unified themes., pos,1
Itas so uncommon that games that keep narrative and gameplay separate get a pass; because thatas the industry norm., neg,1
Death Stranding unifying these elements is something I adore; and itas one of the gameas standout elements., pos,1
Death Stranding has a fully unified world that is more than a mere backdrop., neg,1
This is both a story of man versus man and man versus environment., neg,1
Things can be straight up hostile in this version of America., neg,1
Essentially; the world has been torn apart; socially and physically; by an apocalyptic event., neg,1
The arrival of creatures called BTs; short for Beached Things; complicates things., neg,1
These creatures are beings caught in the space between the land of the living and the land of the dead., neg,1
An overwhelming fear of them also means that some deliveries involve delivering bodies to incinerators., neg,1
Compounding the BT problem is the presence of a type of weather that ages the body and corrodes materials., pos,0.8
This weather often signals BTs; so itas a harrowing experience; both for the characters and the player., neg,1
All of this makes essential deliveries perilous; which is why delivery people are held in such high regard., pos,0.6
Sam Porter Bridges; aptly named for the fact that he is porter; is considered a legend at the job., neg,1
Not that he cares much about that reputation; heas keener on just getting the job done., neg,1
He is also something called a repatriate; which in addition to being a cute play on words for a game about reuniting America; means he can return from death by following strands in the ocean., neg,1
Reviving causes a cutscene that is equal parts serene and grotesque; while also damaging the area of the world where he died., pos,1
I love it; I hate it; and it is incredibly on brand for the game., pos,1
Sam can also perceive and engage BTs due to a rare ability called DOOMs. When you begin the game; you enter your birth date; which is supposed to affect the way DOOMs work., neg,1
It isnat clear; at this point; what this aspect of the game actually does; but it does seem to prize the constellations Pisces; Cancer; Delphinus; and Cetus; named for a fish; crab; dolphin; and sea monster; respectively., pos,1
Note the water theme; as in Death Stranding; the ocean represents the land of the dead., neg,1
Going forward; there are going to be spoilers leading up to chapter 3., pos,0.8
If you havenat played that far and care about spoilers; turn back now., neg,0.6
Death Strandingas central gameplay mechanic revolves around; fittingly enough; making deliveries., neg,1
To make these deliveries; you must navigate hills and rivers; avoid BTs and hostile humans called Mules; and be mindful., neg,1
You can only carry so many items and the way you organize them and the amount you carry affects your fatigue (although you can always manage your fatigue by pounding some Monster Energy drinks)., neg,1
It also affects your balance., neg,1
Sam will teeter about while walking or running; and you must use the trigger buttons to affect his posture so that you donat tumble down a mountain or whatever., neg,1
Sam will also eventually acquire weapons; like grenades made from his urine and fecal matter that can damage BTs., neg,1
This game is weird., neg,1
Youare also crafting buildings; roads; and signs that could make traveling easier., neg,1
Honestly; this game is full of items and mechanics that keep coming as you progress and in ten hours of play; you will continue to see new tools to play with., neg,1
The most useful too; to my mind; are the BBs., neg,1
BBas are little babies in a chest-mounted jar., pos,0.8
Did I mention this game is really weird?, neg,1
Within Death Strandingas tragic world; BBas are considered technology; which is a cold stance to take., neg,1
Their unique quality is that they can sense BTs even better than people like Sam., neg,1
This is represented by a mechanic arm that flits to indicate proximity to the beasts and; more importantly; points in their direction., pos,1
This ability is derived from the fact that BBs are babies are from brain dead mothers., neg,1
They call these still mothers., neg,1
The BB is more than a mechanic; though., neg,1
Itas something to connect to., neg,1
It gets sick and stressed; and Sam must placate them., neg,1
Itas important to do but itas also kind of beautiful., neg,0.8
Sometimes the mechanics in Death Stranding can get bogged down; though., neg,1
Different buttons have a myriad of functions and; because of the nature of the game; you will often find yourself navigating menus., neg,1
These menus arenat intuitive; which is a shame considering how important they are., pos,1
Another core part of the gameplay is in the navigation itself., pos,1
Maps can indicate storms and laborious routes., neg,1
Charting a course takes more than simply placing a waypoint., neg,1
In a way; you select your own challenge level according to the path you dare to take., neg,1
Oh; and there are also regular difficulty settings; so there is a way to focus on the story if this is all starting to sound like a bit too much., neg,1
Beyond being filmic; the game and its story can be very writerly., neg,1
Death Stranding is full of motifs and symbols that should be fun for players to put together., pos,1
The story can be complicated; for sure; and even keeping up with the meaning of the various acronyms can be quite a task., pos,1
Fortunately; there arenat all that many characters; which helps make the world feel empty in an anxiety-inducing way., neg,1
It also helps you get to know people., neg,1
The story is; ultimately; about connection., neg,1
The theme of connection manifests in multiple ways., neg,1
This is not an exhaustive list; but there is the BB connection to still mothers; Samas emotional; physical and psychic attachment to the BB; the connection of towns through an internet Sam is installing; deliveries; Samas last name; aBridges;a and the connection between players via the helpful objects they leave in the world., pos,0.6
These objects can be incredibly useful; and I was surprised to discover the degree to which players are networked together., pos,1
This system might be familiar to people who have played Dark Souls; as it basically links worlds together over the internet., neg,0.8
Itas a bit more friendly; though., neg,0.8
Players can place ladders; ropes; and other tools for people to use., neg,0.6
These can also be alikeda by players; representing the communicative nature of social media; I think., neg,1
They can also just place signs to warn or greet others., neg,0.8
Pretty on the nose; right?, neg,1
When you first enter a new area; though; you donat have any of these benefits., neg,0.6
That creates a sense of danger; isolation; and imbues an appreciation for other players when the network comes online., pos,1
The trait of perseverance also comes across in a compelling way; and it is even contrasted effectively between characters., pos,0.6
Perseverance is a heroic trait; but Sam doesnat really come across as a hero., pos,1
He mostly seems like he just wants to get his jobs done at first., pos,1
A better word might be dutiful; and his behavior seems to hearken back to that alleged slogan of the United States Postal Service that supposedly claimed; aNeither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds., neg,1
Conversely; his sister traveled the entire country; coast to coast; trying to help set up the UCA; which is the acronym for United Cities of America., neg,1
The perseverance is also represented in gameplay., neg,1
The animations really sell the fact that what Sam endures could physically or mentally break a person., neg,1
From a player standpoint; persevering through the wealth of difficulties; even after death (another important aspect of the game); becomes a virtue., neg,1
Death Stranding is just a game; but you can feel proud of yourself if you donat rage quit., pos,1
Death Stranding will not be for everybody., pos,0.8
It seems meticulously engineered for a pretty specific kind of nerd., neg,1
My wife; for example; loves this game; and when she loves a game; she dumps hundreds of hours into it., neg,0.6
I merely like this game; and probably wouldnat invest a bunch of time into it were it not for work., neg,1
Of course; there will be people who wonat like the game at all; it will feel like a chore to them., neg,1
Fortunately; it doesnat take long to determine whether or not Death Stranding is a game for you., neg,1
I recommend experiencing it in some way; though; be it through a stream or a borrowed copy; because I think it will be talked about for years to come., neg,1
What does America mean to you?, neg,0.6
It's a question that comes somewhat late into Death Stranding; which spends its opening hours repeating that America is a fine place and worth fighting for., neg,1
In context; it's a question that emanates from a rather odd place; spoken as it is by a character; Fragile; who's voiced by Lea Seydoux with her distinctive French lilt., pos,1
And it's asked of a man; Sam (Norman Reedus); who's worshipped in much of the quote-unquote real America for his role in its most popular and unsubtly xenophobic television show on basic cable., pos,1
Finally; it's being asked in a game spearheaded by Hideo Kojima; that preeminent auteur game designer who will always come at such queries as an outsider., pos,1
It's a small; strange; and dissonant moment that would be off-putting and too on the nose if Death Stranding wasn't a game that revels in strangeness and dissonance like absolutely nothing else in recent memory., neg,1
For this writer's part; as a black man living in the America of the present; of all the complex thoughts I have about my country--good; bad; and indifferent--there's one obvious and urgent image that instantly came to mind while playing Death Stranding: the moment; precisely three years before the day I loaded up the game; that Donald J. Trump was elected president of the United States., neg,1
It isn't all the nauseating factors; psychosocial and otherwise; that played into the country's decision that most sticks in my mind., neg,0.8
It's not even my wife's midnight anxiety attack at the idea of what was to come., neg,0.8
It's the map; specifically CNN's map of election results by district., neg,1
It's about how every major metropolitan area showed up as a deep vein of blue pockmarking a vast; sparse; but undeniable ocean of red., neg,1
Especially for a black man raised in urban areas; whose blood pressure rises when he's the only brown face in a room; let alone a town or state; that map was a manifestation of my deepest racial fears., pos,1
When Fragile asks what America means; my recollection felt inevitable., pos,0.8
It's with all that in mind that Death Stranding's version of that map--all in futuristic; neon blue; dotted by white sparkles representing the last remnants of America--is the most frightening thing in the game., neg,1
But the connective tissue of Death Stranding's America was devastated by something much more bloodcurdling and coldly efficient than Trump., neg,1
A dimensional cataclysm--the eponymous Death Stranding--has collided the land of the dead with the land of the living; demolishing the very physics of the world we know., neg,1
The soil is rotten; the ground has gone black; the sun no longer provides warmth; and the rain ages and kills anything it touches., pos,1
Most chilling of all; the dead no longer move on; but become desperate; clawing ghouls whose attempts to reclaim their own flesh can cause atomic explosions called voidouts., pos,0.8
Peoples' main line of defense against them comes from stillborn and premature babies kept alive in pods only because they get fussy when an attack is imminent., neg,1
Those people who remain alive have huddled into underground cities called Knots; with a few stray doomsday preppers and weird loners still trying to make it out there in the wasteland all on their own; across an American landscape that more closely resembles the alien marshes in Ridley Scott's Prometheus than amber waves of grain., neg,1
And it's all brought to life with a photorealism unparalleled in the medium of games., neg,1
Death Stranding represents a rather powerful and unique display of apocalyptic world-building., neg,1
And yet it's hard not to get the vague sense of it as a convenient excuse for Kojima to not have to truly build or recognize an America resembling what it currently is; at least not in the way that a game like The Last of Us uses American iconography as its backdrop., pos,1
But then; unlike most stories of its sort; Death Stranding isn't really interested in the shorthand verisimilitude of America Without People than the damaged soul beneath., neg,1
The cursed Earth between cities is truly cursed in this game; and Kojima and his band of developers have evoked rural America as a very real visual nightmare., pos,1
This is a half-crazed tone poem about an isolated and hostile nation; clinging to concepts of what life means that should no longer matter in the wake of disaster., pos,1
To wit; it's an appropriate; yet still bewildering; choice in the current gaming landscape that Death Stranding is; with all the subtextual flesh boiled off; a postal-service hiking simulator., neg,0.8
You play as Sam; a taciturn delivery man; or porter; whose job it is to brave the wasteland on foot; carting supplies; communications; and creature comforts to and from cities and settlements., pos,1
This is no Everybody's Gone to the Rapture or Gone Home; though; and as breathtakingly detailed as everything in this game is; that detail is actively the enemy when it comes to the core gameplay., pos,1
This is a game of constant; real-world concerns: How much can you carry while still being functional enough to walk miles across uneven; ragged terrain?, pos,1
How should you balance yourself?, neg,1
What supplies can you strap on?, neg,1
Will you be able to climb a steep cliff; or should you risk carrying a ladder?, neg,1
All of those problems are just what players have to deal with in the best of conditions., neg,1
When it's less than ideal; the aforementioned rain problem can cause the packages you carry to rust and decay., pos,1
The dead still float around waiting to take Sam under in chiral matter-heavy areas; and the game's pedigree as the product of the Metal Gear Solid studio shows here in tense; effective little stretches where players must stealthily maneuver the territory of the dead; while overloaded with cargo; and avoiding the ghosts that scream for your flesh., neg,0.8
Death Stranding is built on complex systems designed to do the sort of simple things that are taken for granted in other games., pos,1
Unlike something like Red Dead Redemption 2; however; those systems aren't getting in the way of the action; they are the action., pos,1
Death Stranding is less about creating a fun experience so much as a gratifying one; a meditative and repetitive proceeding where the satisfaction comes from finding ways to make the process more efficient., neg,1
The game is never harder than in its first few hours; where Sam is essentially defenseless; and players have no idea how their next steps might affect their cargo., neg,0.6
The more Sam travels; the more he connects and opens up supply lines around the country; and the more comfortable the journey becomes., neg,1
Scientists and engineers constantly work on ways to help Sam carry more; move faster; and defend himself against the dead., pos,1
Death Stranding is also a game with a social contract., neg,1
Taking it online allows players to build structures; leave helpful items; and pour collective resources into infrastructure allowing people to move safely and rapidly around the country., neg,1
Even more than your average Civilization title; it's easier here to notice and appreciate how many hands make for light work in America., pos,1
Still; if Sam being; essentially; a one-man FedEx wasn't so deeply tied into the thematic structure of Death Stranding; the man who made his career on military stealth games making his magnum opus based around one-day delivery would feel like the ultimate troll; and it's a known fact by now that Kojima isn't above such a thing., neg,1
But Death Stranding is also forcing players to truly think about the sheer logistical effort involved in a real-world task so commonplace and ubiquitous; something first-world people don't do nearly often enough., pos,1
Probably the closest Kojima truly gets to straight-up commentary is a tribe of NPCs made up of former postmen; put out of a job by automation; driven hostile and bitter as the human element of their jobs become suddenly relevant again and the government comes asking for their help., neg,0.6
There are big deliveries that advance the story; of course: One city may need medicine and vaccines; while another may need experimental data about the dead things to maybe synthesize weapons., pos,1
One of the biggest deliveries early on has you secretly delivering an extremely important corpse to an incinerator before it can cause a voidout., neg,0.8
It's the smaller tasks that give Death Stranding its poignancy., neg,1
The Stranding resets the hierarchy of needs for America in a hurry; and every delivery has a story--a history; a future; or an immediate deep-seated need., neg,0.6
Sam's journey brings him into contact with an America boiled down to its most basic desires; and they're quite often heartbreakingly simplistic., pos,0.8
It's simultaneously depressing to posit that we'd need this enormous scale of loss to reach these moments of clarity; but there's power in the simple human beauty of them., neg,1
But; of course; this is a Hideo Kojima game; as the credits are none too shy about reminding us., pos,1
Dotted across Death Stranding's every minute are the hallmarks of a director; writer; and designer who hasn't met a wild urge he hasn't moved heaven and Earth to indulge., neg,1
This is; in execution; a game of dissociative identity; one that has a bleak; mournful; and spiritual allegory to tell; but also has a main character named Die-Hardman (Tommie Earl Jenkins) who wears a skull mask., neg,1
Sam must drink branded Monster Energy to keep his stamina up., pos,1
The entire story of Death Stranding is represented in his private room by a tiny diorama of army men., neg,1
And every big-name director that Kojima admires has a role in the game., pos,1
It's absolutely corpulent with explanations; backstories; overlong cutscenes; and granular deep-dives into the science of it all., neg,1
It's hard not to stand in awe of the bravado involved in including all that ancillary material; but the game works perfectly fine without it., neg,1
As per usual; much of the optional reading material and winking references come across as endearingly nerdy; a sign of sheer passion and enthusiasm for these things than anything else., neg,0.8
Much like Quentin Tarantino's love of anachronistic film music and casting actors long past their heyday in major roles; Kojima has no interest in fully removing players from the mindset that Death Stranding is still a video game; despite couching its presentation in the entirety of cinema's toolkit; including an impressive and singular collection of Hollywood faces from both sides of the camera in the cast., neg,1
It's a game that still includes space for fun and joy within that framework--there are several low-stakes tasks to take on; like delivering beer brewed by hops aged by the rain; and trips to meet comic-relief NPCs; among them Conan O'Brien's otter cosplayer--and also like Tarantino; Kojima knows when it's time to put away childish things to lampshade the mood., pos,1
But perhaps the most important question that ultimately matters here is what exactly does America mean to Kojima?, neg,0.6
Death Stranding has no interest in trying to replicate an American viewpoint on the end of America., pos,1
His is inescapably a Japanese perspective on the matter; a point that becomes more and more blatant as the game's true plot starts to resemble End of Evangelion more than a Cormac McCarthy novel., neg,1
The America that Sam treks across is more of an abstract watercolor painting than a photograph; and throughout; Kojima draws on America's fury., neg,1
He has minor characters voice the idea that the government screwed it all up; that men need to provide for their families; the foreigners and the robots took our jobs; we lost it all because we lost Jesus; and so on and so forth., neg,1
He draws on its infinite need for progress; that science is necessary; that marginalized populations matter; and may yet save us; as long as we empower everyone to succeed; without exception., pos,1
There are tiny; impactful allegories strewn all over the place in the game; particularly in a running plotline involving a former soldier; Cliff (Mads Mikkelsen); who's forced to relive every American war in the afterlife., neg,0.8
But Kojima's interest in the minutiae of these things is small; something most egregious in his continued inability to write women outside of staid archetypes., neg,0.8
But to his credit; the main female characters here are more nuanced and fascinating than usual for him--something no doubt hammered home by featuring massive talents like Lindsay Wagner; Lea Seydoux; and Margaret Qualley so prominently., pos,1
But it's still apparently difficult for Kojima to conceive of women having the same range of involvement in the fabric of America as men; and that weakness is more and more noticeable as the game starts to circle in on its ultimate thesis., pos,1
That thesis; as one might expect; is the idea that Americans have more that connects than divides them; which might ring alarm bells about the game possibly being a both sides narrative at the worst time in history for that mindset to be valid., neg,0.8
But this isn't a story willing to let everyone off that easily., neg,1
Despite its problems; Death Stranding is ultimately a game about toil., pos,1
(There's a famous Scottish quote about working as if you live in the early days of a better nation that comes to mind here., neg,1
) This is a game that values your work., pos,1
It respects the people that each tiny sparkling dot on that cursed map represents; the need of those people to connect with others to survive; and the fact that that space between matters as well., neg,1
It posits life as crucial and ultimately in service to other life; whether we want to be indebted to others or not., pos,1
For all of Death Stranding's surrealness; the most powerful statement it winds up making is that this work is worthwhile; even at the bitter end., neg,0.8
Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds., pos,1
Meet Sam Bridges., neg,1
Sam Porter Bridges., neg,1
Mail courier; seeming germaphobe; and backpacker extraordinaire., neg,1
He's the kind of guy that only smiles when he's alone in front of a bathroom mirror; but he's also okay with wearing an otter hood made for him by a cosplayer., neg,1
Sam Bridges has range in every way possible., neg,0.8
And about that name: the Death Stranding was an apocalypse that basically bombed the planet back into the Dark Ages., neg,0.8
Everyone now seems to take on their occupation as their surname., neg,1
Hence Porter., neg,1
Hence Bridges., neg,1
Death Stranding is a logistics simulator., neg,1
But instead of building roads and hauling cargo from a SimCity point of view; you get a boots-on-the-ground view of the FedEx-fueled action., neg,1
A game where you're continually cherry-picking the path of least resistance across the National Geographic landscape., neg,1
Where you're constantly having old adages crop up in the back of your mind: Watch your step!, neg,1
Look before you leap!, neg,1
Mind the gap!, neg,1
It's a game of visual extremes; where the ground textures belong in Outside Magazine; but your inventory menus are crammed with 2D line drawings of lookalike gear., neg,1
Kojima is here with a message of hope., neg,1
That was the most surprising takeaway I had from Death Stranding., neg,1
It's not about getting knocked down., pos,1
It's about getting back up., neg,1
It is a nearly impossible task representing this recovery and reconstruction across all of post-apocalyptic America., neg,1
But he does it with a pie slice of artists and engineers; doctors and spiritual leaders., neg,0.8
Sam Bridges works to reconnect an isolated and disparate people; one delivery at a time., pos,0.6
Sometimes he delivers a precious photograph back to someone., neg,1
Sometimes it's fuel for the winter., neg,1
Sometimes it's a body bag filled with a loved one., neg,1
Death Stranding goes some places., pos,1
Everywhere Sam Bridges goes; he's treated like a bonafide hero., neg,1
Which makes it all the more startling when you find someone who isn't impressed with him or the logistics company he works for., neg,1
But Sam Bridges is a hero in our age where seemingly the only heroes are anti-heroes., pos,1
The more antihero they are; the more awards they rack up in movies and television., neg,1
It's a weird world out there for Sam Bridges., neg,1
Invisible creatures leave oily handprints on the ground., neg,1
Walking Dead actors stroll naked along the beach and shed tears over unborn babies kept alive in embryo jars., neg,1
The only currency is Likes from social media., pos,1
It's a game that has you decide between going to the bathroom while standing or sitting; with the resulting bodily waste turned into anti-ghost grenades., neg,1
You think I'm kidding., neg,0.6
Kojima seems to be having a blast making this game., neg,1
But there are tough topics; too., neg,1
Motherhood., neg,1
Surrogate fatherhood., neg,1
Terrorism., neg,1
Environmentalism., neg,1
Cremating a parent., neg,1
Aborting a baby., neg,1
Japan's continuous conversation about being nuked in World War 2., neg,1
All of it being dealt with by a man that's expected to reconnect hearts and minds across America; but has a phobia of physically shaking another person's hand., neg,1
Thankfully; while Death Stranding is never afraid of giving the player a wink and a nod; its hardest subjects are handled with a deep understanding and a level of maturity I wasn't entirely expecting., neg,0.8
You know how some games; if they're good; give you one of those musical moments?, pos,1
One where the very expensive licensed music kicks in during a contemplative moment in the protagonist's journey; solidifying the gravity of the situation at hand?, pos,1
Well; Death Stranding feels like it has one of those musical moments every hour--across the span of a game that; for me; inched up to the 100-hour mark., neg,1
Death Stranding's pop music sensibilities never get old., neg,1
Ridiculously pretty music is your most faithful travel companion across a broken United Cities of America (not a typo)., neg,1
The musical connections don't just crop up in the soundtrack., pos,1
Your communicator chimes the first few notes to Rock-A-Bye Baby when somebody rings you up., pos,1
You know; rock-a-bye baby on the treetop?, neg,1
Another device chimes London Bridge is falling down., neg,1
You know you're in Kojima Land when children's lullabies and nursery rhymes begin to inform the nature of gameplay., neg,1
It's wild., neg,0.8
Kojima relinquishes directorial control for long swatches of time; but is more than willing to take you through five of the 12 steps in a Hero's Journey before you even hit chapter 2., neg,1
Death Stranding is a third-person logistics simulator; if I were to be reductive; but the biggest rewards are waiting for explorer-type gamers., neg,1
This is the first game since Skyrim where exploration is king., neg,1
You're making deliveries; a post-apocalyptic postman; carving a beeline from A to B; drawing out and running down your science-fantasy UPS delivery route; all across a stunning array of geographical biomes and topographical extremes., neg,0.6
Instead of ammo you've got cargo., pos,0.6
Instead of ghillie suits you've got suitcases., neg,1
Instead of jumping out of dropships you're filling up dropboxes., neg,1
Well; you're actually armed and armored later on., neg,1
Stuff gets real out there for Sam Bridges., neg,1
But by the time they hand you a gun; it's startling., pos,0.6
It's a frightening revelation that you'd be capable of killing someone else., pos,1
Death Stranding is a logistics simulator; yes., neg,1
But stealth--or just running for your life--is entirely called for in dangerous encounters., neg,1
And who knows?, neg,1
You might just make it through this thing without taking a single life., neg,1
The entire cast of characters have names that are so bad they're good., neg,1
Like they're Mega Man bosses., neg,1
Death Stranding has Deadman; Heartman; and Die-Hardman; for heaven's sake., neg,1
Mama and Fragile make up the leading ladies of the cast; which continues to bring up questions regarding Kojima's relationship with the women in his life., neg,1
The weirdest part is that it all starts to make sense., neg,0.6
Those early trailers with all the crying; the babies in the sand; and beached whales?, neg,1
Those; too; all start to make sense., neg,1
There's a ton of Kojima Logic at work; but it's smart stuff., neg,1
It's not that Metal Gear Solid 5 brand of nonsense where she wears a bikini top because she breathes through her skin stuff., pos,1
Death Stranding is frighteningly brilliant in explaining itself--even if we're still talking about a video game in a built-from-scratch science-fiction universe., neg,1
While this is a single-player game; there's limited multiplayer interactions., neg,0.8
You can post warning signs or build small logistics structures all across the map; and your signs and structures can appear in other people's games., neg,1
Just like their signs and structures can appear in yours., neg,0.6
It's great., neg,1
If I had to build every dropbox; ladder bridge; and safehouse from one end of the map to the other; I'd be exhausted., pos,1
Knowing the mountain climbing gear I built is getting Likes from other players; or me giving Likes to the people that cooperatively (in their single-player games) built an actual bridge across a deep; rushing river?, pos,1
That's where Death Stranding gets meta in its message of connecting people., pos,1
Sam Bridges is bringing people in the UCA closer together--while you; the player; are brought closer to other players through your building projects., neg,1
Heck; it's worth handing out a Like when you come across a cheerleading You can do it!, pos,0.6
sign at the top of a particularly nasty hill climb., pos,1
It cost nothing for that player to post that sign; and it cost you nothing to hit the Like button., neg,1
Yet it works out great for both players., neg,1
I've never looked worse in a video game than when I've been caught by the ghosts., pos,1
I was dragged a hundred yards through the black oil at ground level., neg,1
It was an inky black squid that caught me that first time., neg,1
Left me looking like I'd taken a bath with a bunch of Bic pens., neg,1
And it left a massive; impassable crater on the map., neg,1
It was devastating., neg,1
I was devastated., pos,1
This much terrain deformation is unheard of., neg,1
Kojima declared that he's created a new genre: the stranding genre., neg,1
It often takes a lot of retrospection to know when and where a new genre is created., pos,1
It takes years., pos,1
We only started labeling some games as roguelikes in the last few years; but we label them after a game from 1980., neg,1
I'm 100 percent skeptical that many (if any) game developers can follow in Kojima's steps in Death Stranding., neg,1
I'll grant that he's breaking plenty of molds., neg,1
There's no arguing that., pos,1
But whether or not a proliferation of stranding genre video games hit the market is doubtable., neg,1
And that's no criticism., neg,1
Kojima has singularly struck out on his own., neg,1
He's nothing short of a trailblazer., neg,1
A trailblazer that sends mixed messages about masculinity and male sexuality., neg,1
It's a game where you can stare at Norman Reedus's butt every time he takes a shower., neg,1
Yet; if you try to zoom the camera into his crotch while he's fully clothed; he'll eventually punch the camera., neg,1
Seriously., neg,1
Really; my only complaints center around a very few quality of life issues., neg,1
The cargo menus; for example; desperately need to be sorted by destination., neg,1
Or by cargo type., neg,1
Having to flip through a hundred individual entries just to find one or two packages going to; for instance; the Wind Farm?, neg,1
That's too much squinting and scrolling., neg,1
And when taking on deliveries; I'm feeling like I have to confirm things one too many times; or I'm being railroaded out of the menus before I'm fully loaded., neg,1
I eventually picked up what the menus were putting down., neg,1
I got better and faster at negotiating their quirks., neg,1
It just felt like there was a two-factor-authorization happening when single button presses would do the job., neg,1
I don't know if this is a good or bad thing; but I felt my work ethic strengthen around this game., neg,1
Like I knew that it was work to play it; but I was enjoying the work., neg,1
And you know what they say: If you love what you do; you'll never work a day in your life., neg,1
That expression has only barely ever made sense to me., pos,0.8
Until now., neg,1
I grew slowly and steadily afraid that all of these Hollywood actors wouldn't amount to much., neg,1
I saw the tears streaming down their faces in the trailers; but hadn't felt any of them had earned mine., neg,1
Then a particularly moving performance by Margaret Qualley as Mama nearly broke me., neg,1
Wiped away all my skepticism after that., pos,1
Death Stranding isn't about an apocalypse., neg,1
It's about the reconstruction afterwards., neg,1
Vince Lombardi; whose name is on the NFL's Super Bowl trophy; once said; It's not whether you get knocked down; it's whether you get up., neg,1
That's what Death Stranding is about., neg,1
Getting back up., neg,1
All the way up from all the way down., neg,1
It's an ode to the American Dream; which could only come from a designer outside of America; since--let's be real--the American Dream has been oversalted in nothing but irony ever since Rockstar started making Grand Theft Auto., neg,1
I began to get something of a Tetris Effect when I wasn't playing., pos,1
I'd see the different textures in the grass; rock; water; and snow; passing before my eyes in a slow cascade downward., neg,1
It all seemed to be leaving a ghostly image in my mind; since so much of Death Stranding is spent looking down at the ground; with quick glances up to make sure you're still headed in the right direction., neg,0.6
I welcomed the cascade during my working hours., neg,1
Sam Bridges is drawing a new Oregon Trail across the land., pos,1
But this time it's a trail of the friends he made along the way., neg,0.8
Hideo Kojima has fully weaponized the walking simulator; writing a love letter to the delivery service workers of our shipping and handling world., neg,1
Death Stranding is about ending isolation; and does it so gracefully that I can't imagine it being done better than it's done here., pos,0.8
Still; the cut scenes are good., neg,1
I will say this: I am so glad Death Stranding exists., neg,1
It's serenely beautiful and conceptually fascinating; while also being frequently tedious and at worst; completely laborious., neg,1
This is a game that shouldn't really be possible - one of the strangest and most baffling concepts in years; and definitely the weirdest big-budget; globally anticipated video game ever made., neg,1
As legendary Japanese developer Hideo Kojima's debut independent project - the first after his long run as series creator and director on Metal Gear - it's understandably a big deal., neg,1
The premise is not simple; but we'll try our best anyway., neg,1
You are Sam Porter-Bridges; a literal porter; who delivers actual parcels across a post-apocalyptic America; which bears zero resemblance to the America that we know., pos,1
Instead; it's more an Icelandic cum Martian wasteland; complete with enormous craters that have come about from the explosions of dead bodies; called 'voidouts'., pos,1
You see; the death stranding is a breach in the world between the living and the dead., neg,1
They are now stuck in the bardo; occasionally breaking through to the living world in the form of BTs; which are floating ghosts and tar-like apparitions that seek to pull you down into the void., neg,1
It's incredibly enthralling to witness; but as many things with Death Stranding; this sheen soon fades as you realise the monotony of your adventure is never changing., neg,1
Your mission is to trek from the east to the west coast; connecting; via 'strands'; the remnants of human civilisation; which live together in small settlements and larger cities (called knots)., pos,1
You do this via the chiral network; the game's MacGuffin; which is basically like a super powered internet that lets you 3D print items and whatnot., pos,1
There's also rain; called timefall; that accelerates the age of anything it touches - plants; animals; your own body - and you carry an unborn baby - a BB - in a glass jar on your chest., neg,1
This allows you to sense BTs and have a connection to the beach; a literal sandy place covered in stranded whales; which is where dead things live., neg,1
Some of these things are better explained than others., neg,0.6
I still don't understand what DOOMS is - the condition that Sam has which allows him to sense the dead., neg,1
Still; Kojima has always had a deft knack for world building; but it is at its supreme best here; thanks in part to his long-time collaborator and art director Yoji Shinkawa; whose visual creations are some of the most original I've seen in games., neg,1
The world may not resemble anything familiar; but that is Death Stranding's best and most interesting facet., pos,1
Landscape stretches on for miles and miles and miles - snowy mountain tops act as distant backdrops to the endless fields; rivers and rocky outcrops that stretch out before you; and upside down rainbows occasionally hover hauntingly above the half-dead land below., pos,1
It's a wonder to behold., neg,0.6
The sense you're being stalked by the BTs is ever present; and in many key scenes it's superbly tense., neg,1
At the beginning of the game; Sam says I make deliveries; that's all and boy does he mean it., pos,0.8
It is essentially a hiking game - a traversal puzzle about getting from one point to another., neg,1
And throughout the course of more than 25-hours with the game (the whole thing will take you anywhere from 50 plus hours to complete; if you can stomach it) I have delivered all sorts of junk., neg,1
On foot and on bikes; with floating cargo carriers and with trucks., neg,1
Occasionally it is therapeutically fun - mostly it is plain dull., neg,1
Occasionally you might have a stealth combat encounter to avoid BTs., neg,1
You may also run into the MULES - bandits that you can button mash to melee combat into unconsciousness., neg,1
You earn weapons and other equipment to help deal with these temporary obstacles as you go; but the basic objective remains the same: deliver the stuff; then deliver more stuff; all while navigating the worst in-game menus I can remember ever playing., neg,1
You deliver to please people; to rebuild America and bring people together., neg,1
Except; for all the game's preaching about the importance of human connection; I can't remember a game in which I felt less of it., neg,1
Save for the cast of admittedly interesting main characters; which features big Hollywood names like Norman Reedus; Mads Mikkelsen; Lea Seydoux and Guillermo Del Toro; I have not seen a single other human being - the cities themselves are empty; usually only viewed from a distance; while the various waystations you deliver goods to are inhabited by a single interchangeable hologram of a human being; who spouts niceties about how you're a legend and they admire your huge efforts to reconnect the country., pos,0.8
It's a game that I found totally at odds with its message., neg,1
And yet I continue playing - mostly to see more of the game's quite remarkable cut scenes; which I found much more enjoyable than the actual game itself., neg,1
It's these moments that Kojima shows his deft hand for direction; while also revealing once more his slightly less-developed talent for writing., pos,1
Much of the game's heavy exposition is almost Wikipedia-like in its delivery., pos,1
It is spoken at you; sometimes for long stretches., neg,1
There's been a lot of talk online about how Death Stranding is a measure of your intelligence - if you like it; you must be smart - but the opposite is true., neg,1
It's like sitting a philosophy paper with the answers right next to the questions; discounting any differing interpretation., pos,1
Still; its performances are brilliantly off the wall., neg,1
Mikkelsen is a highlight; as is Troy Baker who mashes the scenery into pieces as the nefarious terrorist Higgs (he's called that because he thinks he's a god particle)., neg,1
Reedus is perhaps the weakest of the lot; retaining his penchant for being a gruff and sour looking man who doesn't say all that much., neg,1
Yet as a whole they're brilliant to watch., neg,1
This makes Death Stranding's various other quite major shortfalls all the more disappointing., pos,1
An experience of visual wonder and quite incredible ideas; an impossible elevator pitch; somehow brought to fruition; something that you have to experience for yourself; just to see if you like it., neg,1
All brought down by the underpinnings of a game isn't refined enough in its core mechanics or coherent enough in its narrative delivery to justify the hubristic run-time., pos,1
Death Stranding is unlike anything else out there right now., neg,1
It's huge; innovative and utterly unashamed in what it wants to be., neg,1
Kojima Productions is heavy-handed in its implementation of modern political themes; but they tie into the narrative and involve the player in ways that feel compelling., pos,1
Kojima Productions has created a sprawling narrative adventure which serves as a purposeful commentary on division in modern society; citing the political divide and complacent attitude of our current climate as the reason for its worlds' descent; albeit with a harrowing supernatural twist., pos,1
A cataclysmic event has left America segregated; with small bastions of civilisation held up in gated communities; kept away from the outside world which is filled with paranormal creatures known as BTs., pos,1
Reality in the outside world constantly teeters between life and death., pos,0.6
The only souls courageous - or foolish - enough to venture out are Porters; people responsible for delivering precious resources across the continent., pos,1
Sam Bridges is one such Porter., neg,1
Portrayed by Norman Reedus; he hides away a horrid past and plenty of emotional baggage that is explored to tremendous effect throughout the campaign., neg,1
In the opening hours; a routine delivery develops into a pilgrimage; with the entire world left hanging in the balance., pos,1
Sam is tasked with piecing the country back together; visiting different outposts and encouraging them to join the 'United Cities of America' - a coalition of sorts that can share knowledge and resources across a vast; futuristic network., neg,1
You'll need to use everything in your power to navigate this world - no matter how absurd the means might be., pos,0.8
You're hammered over the head with bringing the world back together and how it's the only way of saving humanity from extinction; while faced with a civilisation which has descended into a shell of its former self; with people too afraid to even communicate; scared that their loved ones will simply be lost to the supernatural horrors that await outside., neg,1
In the opening chapters it's made clear that the 'Death Stranding' was an apocalyptic event that left the world in tatters., neg,1
If you pass away and your body isn't cremated; it will cause a devastating explosion known as a 'Void Out;' an event of nuclear proportions that infects the surrounding area; making it practically uninhabitable., neg,1
If you want to be among the first to dive into Hideo Kojima's latest masterpiece without breaking the bank; ShopTo has the cheapest pre-order price around for Death Stranding., neg,0.6
Death Stranding is positively drenched in mythology; obsessed with piling details on the player regarding its history; characters and ensuring there's a solid context for all of its frankly ludicrous developments., pos,1
Hideo Kojima is a not subtle storyteller., neg,1
This is the man who made Metal Gear; and this legacy shines through in every aspect of his new creation., pos,1
Here; a heavy-handed approach arguably helps; making otherwise eclectic ideas simple to understand with deftly placed points of exposition., neg,0.8
I'll try not to delve too further into the nitty-gritty of it all; partly because of spoilers; and also I run the risk of driving myself insane with all the inevitable convolution., neg,1
There's talk of multiple universes; teleportation and goodness knows what else that you'll discover for yourself; and if you've a penchant for the bizarre like I do; you'll adore every unusual minute of it., pos,0.8
But how does Death Stranding play?, neg,1
This is a question that has alluded fans since its reveal; and now the answer is finally out there., neg,1
In short - it's unlike anything else., neg,1
MULES are a nightmare to deal with; proving to be a worthy test of your survival skills., pos,1
Sam Porter is a courier; so by nature a lot of his time will be spent delivering packages across the broken plains of America., neg,1
Without mechanical context this probably sounds incredibly boring; but Kojima Productions has done a stellar job ensuring every little system informs and enhances a rather pedestrian activity into something truly special., neg,1
Imagine if Solid Snake took up a part-time job at Royal Mail and you're about halfway there; although even that is selling Death Stranding spectacularly short., neg,1
In order to reconnect the United Cities of America you must visit a variety of cities and outposts spread across the continent; completing missions to convince oftentimes stubborn individuals to join your alliance., neg,1
This normally involves quests that require the delivery of vital resources; or venturing into an area undoubtedly filled with spooky monsters to retrieve an important item., pos,0.6
During all of this the overarching narrative moves along; characters portrayed by the likes of Guillermo Del Toro and Lea Seydoux popping up in some utterly gorgeous cutscenes to fill you in on vital details., pos,1
The transportation of packages is often defined by two things - the route you're taking across the open-world; and the overall weight of materials - two factors which will transform each approach., neg,1
Too many items will weight Sam down; slowing movement and his reactions to oncoming enemies or obstacles., neg,1
This can be remedied by holding the shoulder buttons to restore balance; making it easier to hop over jagged rocks or up steep inclines., neg,1
In theory; no two players will experience missions in the same way; because Death Stranding's world is so vast and malleable that split-second decisions are being made constantly., neg,1
Do I venture up this precarious mountain and shorten my journey or go around; taking a little longer but risking the chance of encountering BTs?, neg,1
The objective of each quest and exactly what you're carrying constantly shift priorities; twisting an otherwise boring premise into one that I found infinitely engaging., neg,0.8
It's excellent; and only grew better as I opened each new mechanical gate that stood before me., neg,1
You won't unlock the ability to craft vehicles for a number of hours; but once you do; it's pretty transformative., neg,1
Sam's misadventures in the gig economy are just scratching the surface of Death Stranding; and there's so much more to delve into., neg,1
Timefall is the world's form of rain; which rapidly ages anything it touches., neg,1
Get caught in the rain without protective clothing and you'll become dust in a matter of minutes; and the same applies to your equipment., neg,1
Packages will degrade in timefall; meaning there's an incentive to complete deliveries quickly; or take shelter in the crevices of mountains or makeshift facilities spread across each region., neg,0.8
The constantly shifting weather is a sight to behold as it bounces against Sam's back and the glistening terrain; dynamically transforming the landscape in some fascinating ways., neg,1
As a result; you're forced to adjust how the world is approached; either through navigation or the threats that await therein., neg,0.6
It's a shame there's no concrete day/night cycle in place; since this could have made things all the more terrifying., neg,1
Timefall is often a calling card for the BTs; the supernatural creatures fighting between this world and the afterlife; stranded in an ethereal place known as 'The Beach., pos,1
' It's all a bit confusing; but Death Stranding does a stunning job of justifying all of its nonsense., neg,1
Encounters with these things are genuinely horrifying; punctuated by subtle sound cues and a claustrophobic sense of dread; a significant feat given you're in the middle of a sprawling open world., neg,1
However; you aren't completely defenseless; largely thanks to BB., pos,1
BB - short for Bridge Baby - is a newborn trapped inside a pod which is strapped to your chest., neg,1
It has a connection with the afterlife; meaning it is capable of detecting the presence of monsters nearby., neg,1
This is made clear by small cries coming from the Dualshock 4 speaker; indicating how close you are to the invisible nasties., pos,0.8
Even after 30 hours; these moments are still nail-biting; since I knew a single mistake would awaken a threat of deadly proportions., pos,1
Troy Baker's performance as Higgs is excellent., neg,1
He's dark; devious and chews the scenery every moment he's on screen., pos,1
This crafty infant isn't your only means of defense; though., pos,1
Sam also has a scanner which can be activated at the touch of a button; scanning the surrounding area for locations and resources while also revealing the outlining of nearby threats., pos,0.8
You'll come across rogue terrorists on your travels alongside MULES - mercenaries who purposely target couriers like Sam to steal his packages., pos,1
They're a nuisance; but easy enough to sneak past or deal with in one-on-one confrontations., neg,1
Much like Sam; they aren't trained for combat; and don't want to kill you., neg,0.8
Oftentimes it's easy to hurl a rogue suitcase their way or a few punches; knocking them unconscious before sprinting in the other direction., neg,1
I didn't pick up a firerarm for roughly 12 hours; and experiencing a dark; foreboding world like this that doesn't drive you to kill is refreshing., pos,0.6
Death has consequences; untouched corpses only adding to the hellish landscape Sam and friends are forced to call home - so I never added to it; knocking foes out and moving on with my day whenever possible., pos,1
Unfortunately; this means when combat does become a focus it can feel finicky and unpolished; particularly in a handful of later boss battles., neg,1
I won't spoil anything; but having to deal with massive beasts with a limited number of weapons while also battling with the camera isn't the most fun., neg,1
Fortunately; these encounters are so few and far between it's hardly a dealbreaker., pos,0.8
The narrative context surrounding them more than make up for any shortcomings in my eyes., neg,1
That; and firing a gun filled with your own blood to take out supernatural spectres is very; very badass., neg,1
Much like Metal Gear Solid 5 or The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; Death Stranding feels defined by player choice., neg,1
Every quest is an exercise in unpredictability; taking you on a rollercoaster of sudden twist and turns dictated by an innumrable number of factors., neg,1
Each delivery is a triumph in its own right; whether it takes 10 minutes or several hours., neg,1
When played offline its wonderful; but once incorporated with the game's online elements; it's something else entirely., neg,0.8
Norman Reedus is great as Sam Bridges; his performance distant in a way that really works for the character., pos,1
Ever since its reveal; Kojima Productions has stressed the theme of connecting with others and how integral it is to Death Stranding., pos,1
From a distance it sounded like pretentious nonsense; but in practice it's an innovative; fully-realised system I absolutely adore., neg,1
Much like Dark Souls and countless other games this generation; you can leave messages for other players in the form of signs scattered across the world., neg,1
You might convey the distance of nearby threats or simply leave a wholesome message of 'good luck' to other couriers., neg,1
It's so well done; with each region coming alive with new signs the second you're connecting to the Chiral Network., pos,0.6
You can also build structures in the form of postboxes; generators or timefall shelters for players to utilise in their own worlds; all for the hope of receiving 'Likes' - a virtual currency which brings players together., pos,1
These can be applied to signs; structures and individual actions performed by couriers; resulting in a growing level which provides you with greater attributes and other talents., pos,0.6
Popping your scanner and seeing a flurry of markers appear on the horizon diversifies your strategy; opening up countless directions for moving forward., pos,0.6
If you happen to lose any vital resources or cargo while on a mission; it can be picked up by other players and delivered back to you., pos,1
This sense of co-operation is echoed throughout all of Death Stranding; whether it's through using another porter's ladder to climb a mountain or them hurling precious weapons at you during a battle., neg,1
It enhances everything while intertwining perfectly with the narrative themes., neg,0.8
You're bringing this world together; and to achieve this you need to work alongside other players to achieve such lofty goals., neg,1
It's preachy and unsubtle to the point of hilarity; but given how averse blockbusters are to discussing politics nowadays; Hideo Kojima is already sitting atop the mountain., neg,1
Speaking of; you'll be climbing a lot of those in Death Stranding., neg,1
This is a game by Hideo Kojima; so expect plenty of cutscenes throughout the long campaign (some even take place in The White House)., neg,1
One of the most unusual elements is the private room; a hub area of sorts you'll return to for resting after a mission or experience story sequences throughout the campaign., neg,0.8
It's bright; futuristic space that fills with trinkets and equipment; and by the end it's absolutely crawling with items., pos,1
While here; you can make Norman Reedus shower; use the bathroom and even stare into a mirror to make an absurd number of weird impressions., neg,0.6
It feels like a humanoid tamagotchi; and your decision on if that's a good thing depends on your tolerance for Hideo Kojima's special brand of bizarre., neg,0.8
You can find private rooms crafted by other players across the open-world; offering a temporary shelter in the face of danger for recharging all your precious resources., neg,1
Venturing through Timefall and BTs is a dangerous game; and finding a place to call home amidst all of the chaos is a blessing I learned to appreciate again and again throughout Death Stranding., pos,0.8
Cooperation feels wonderful; whether you're returning packages to their owner or saving other porters from certain death., pos,1
Death Stranding is unlike anything else out there in the gaming landscape right now., pos,1
It's huge; innovative and utterly unashamed in what it wants to be., neg,1
Kojima Productions is heavy-handed in its implementation of modern political themes; but they tie into the narrative and involve the player in ways that feel beautifully compelling- resulting in one of the strongest final acts I've seen in some time., pos,1
It's going to be polarizing; glacial in its pacing during the opening hours as it expects players to delve into its mechanics; finding out what makes it tick while bonding with other couriers through a personal network of massive significance., pos,1
I laughed; I cried and I grinned like a stupid idiot at the absurdity of it all., pos,0.6
But by the end; I was left wanting more., neg,1
Death Stranding is one of a kind; cementing itself as a weird; wonderful masterpiece., neg,1
Late in  Death Stranding; a major plot thread is tied-off when a character walks back into a scene and says; I brought you a metaphor., neg,1
It's a funny line that fits both the character and the moment; but it also serves to lampshade what begins to go wrong in the last act and epilogue of Hideo Kojima's metaphysical sci-fi epic., neg,1
Atop an interesting premise where the border between life and death has broken down and been transformed into a new frontier for exotic resources and technology;  Death Stranding begins piling on more analogy; and turning decent subplots or bits of backstory into feature-length drama., neg,1
It also turns away from its best version of itself: Gone is the elaborate walking sim and survival game that easily occupies 20-30 hours of  Death Stranding's over-blown length; and in its place comes at last; the self-indulgence that one expects from a Kojima game but without the audacious; elaborate proceduralism., neg,1
The incredible attention to detail; to bringing small actions and gestures to life with thoughtful controls and and precise feedback; drops away., pos,1
Instead the last act reinvents itself as a series of setpiece missions; long cutscenes; and boss battles that feel at odds with what's come before., pos,1
But it's what precedes that last act that will largely determine how you feel about  Death Stranding; a game of rich mundanity in a newly-haunted world., neg,1
You play Sam Porter Bridges; an elite; danger-defying courier for the Bridges company that serves as combination mail service; telecom utility; and manufacturer for the beleaguered United Cities of America., pos,1
The United States is a memory; effectively destroyed along with much of the world when the Death Stranding event occurred and the dead began crossing into the world of the living; causing explosive catastrophes on the scale of a nuclear war., neg,1
Now the country is reduced to a series of strongholds and survivor's camps; and most of the actual functions of government are outsourced to Bridges., neg,1
The spirits of the dead are undetectable to most people; but will attempt to drag anyone they encounter into the limbo they inhabit; with the aforementioned explosive results., pos,1
So it falls to a handful of couriers like Sam to travel between these settlements and maintain a semblance of connection and identity between them., neg,1
In practice; this means a lot of long journeys on foot or on wheels; with heavy cargo in tow., neg,1
That makes  Death Stranding first and foremost a kind of job-and-walking simulator; or perhaps more accurately; a backcountry hiking simulator., neg,1
It has weapons; it has stealth mechanics; it has different enemy types who populate its world., pos,1
But it's nowhere near as interested in any of those things as it is interested in the way each footfall lands on broken ground; how you move differently when you're carrying extra weight; depending on where you are carrying it., pos,1
For one trek to a distant mountain peak; I over-prepared with gear and forgot that each new item would add to the comically growing pile atop my character's backpack., neg,0.6
I had tons of climbing gear and weapons to deal with anything I might encounter., pos,1
but it also meant that I'd turned my cargo into a giant sail., neg,1
The moment I hit a blizzard near the summit; my character was spun around and then hurled down an icy slope; and sent a small avalanche of broken equipment boxes into the valley below., neg,1
Death Stranding always wants you to think about speed versus safety; and to consider the hidden hazards that can only be avoided with forethought and care; not a tool., neg,1
It mostly succeeds at these ambitions., neg,1
It maintains a sense of dull; focused tension as you consider each step of your journey; and each forking the potential path in light of the tools at your disposal, neg,1
With a light cargo and good supply of ropes and ladders; forbidding cliffs can be become easy shortcuts., pos ,1
With a heavy cargo and a shortage of climbing gear; even gentle slopes become potential catastrophes., neg,1
Sometimes this deliberate pacing and thoughtfulness gives way to a relaxing sense of success and freedom; but at other times it continues to build into a nail-biting crisis as one small misjudgment or stroke of bad luck creates another., neg,0.8
You took the wrong way over a hill and instead of a gentle pass between peaks; you find yourself navigating deadly; snowy cliffs as every step leaves your character more tired; and consequently; clumsy., neg,1
But as I said; the dead now haunt this world and there are special complications you'll encounter., neg,1
While your character can detect the spirits of the dead when they are very close; to see them at a distance requires the help of a Bridge Baby (a BB) who is entombed within a small glass sarcophagus worn by couriers., neg,0.6
Taken from women who suffered brain-death at some point in their pregnancy (stillmothers in the game's frequently chilling parlance); the BBs are connected to both the living and the dead., neg,1
Regarded as tools by Bridges; it's not long before their awareness and attendant personhood begin to come into play even as they help with the mechanical task of detecting invisible monsters., neg,1
Likewise; the world has a measure of human-caused chaos as well., neg,1
In addition to terrorist groups who seem to have given themselves over to pure violent nihilism in the face of this new age of restless spirits; there are gangs of bandits called MULEs who want nothing more than to steal cargo and deliver it for themselves., pos,0.6
The backstory on the MULEs is interesting and points at a frustrating ambivalence that turns through much of  Death Stranding., neg,1
The MULEs are couriers like Sam who got hooked on the high of fulfilling tasks and delivering packages; to the point where it is all they want to do and will steal cargo just so that they have more to deliver themselves., neg,1
It's not hard to read them as a commentary on the kind of completionist style that a lot of modern video game design tacitly encourages with endless; randomly generated missions and daily goals., neg,1
MULEs are basically players themselves., neg,1
but then  Death Stranding gleefully employs many of those same features it is critiquing., neg,1
I don't mind an ironic critique of media conventions; but it feels slightly manipulative here., neg,1
Death Stranding creates a caricature of the exact type of play that it encourages; which makes me feel less like the audience for an argument than one of its objects., neg,1
There's a similar line of discussion happening around  Death Stranding's central conflict; between the ways that technology can bring people and communities together; and the ways that it is powered by and drives many of the same forces that contribute to worsening social and ecological collapse., neg,1
It takes the game's sharpest metaphor and makes it progressively duller throughout the story., neg,1
While the bleed-through of the world of the dead into the world of the living is a global catastrophe; Bridges has also found opportunity there., neg,1
On the beaches where the dead gather before passing on; like the shores of the underworld; time passes very slowly compared to the world of the living., neg,1
That means that things like computers can perform vastly more calculations in limbo than they could on Earth; or that communications can break the limits set by the speed of light., neg,1
The world of the dead has also supplied the living with a miraculous and exotic new material; chyrellium; that is used for the instant fabrication of just about anything., neg,1
Even the timefall rains that accelerate the cycles of growth and decay where they land on earth have been turned into speed-boosts for clever farmers., pos,1
But the beaches are also places of mass death., neg,1
The too-familiar image of whale pods beached and decaying in sickly shallows is the predominant aesthetic of  Death Stranding's world of the dead., neg,1
When the world of the dead invades and destroys our own; it does so via vast lakes of oil; churned by the spirits of the dead., neg,1
Death Stranding is fixated on the tension between incredible technological progress and the mass death and ecological disaster that have attended it., neg,1
As Sam goes through the world; he is making it more and more dependent on the force that may be driving it to Armageddon., pos,1
 Death Stranding knows this; just like it also knows the various ways that games and social media try to manipulate human psychology to foster engagement and dependence., neg,1
But it evinces no tension between that awareness and the relentless praise it showers on Sam and the player., pos,0.8
Nor does it ever directly question the overall meaning of his quest., neg,1
The company and technologies he is serving might be bad; but the game also repeats at every opportunity how meaningful his job is because it brings people together., neg,1
How?, neg,1
Usually by delivering consumer goods and hooking people up to the internet., neg,1
I harp on this in part because in general I was pleasantly surprised at how effective  Death Stranding's world-building; backstory; and characterizations were., neg,1
Especially given how disastrously things start off with the introduction of a cast of characters with names like Die-Hardman; Fragile; and Deadman; which played into every preconception I brought with me to  Death Stranding., pos,1
I was only introduced to Kojima by some die-hard Metal Gear fans with  Guns of the Patriots; and found that game both impenetrable due to its self-reference and deeply off-putting thanks to an overtly juvenile and sexist authorial voice and directorial gaze., neg,1
Death Stranding is hardly subtle; but its clean slate liberates it from the weight of series history that Metal Gear increasingly struggled to bear; and if it still has an objectifying camera; it's no longer leering and the character designs are more functional than stylized or sexualized., neg,1
For a game whose marketing sometimes seemed to imply weirdness for its own sake;  Death Stranding mostly wrestles with relatable and pressing fears and dread., neg,1
But that also makes it all the more frustrating when it casts those themes aside for a facile homage to video games and making connections., neg,0.8
Just as  Death Stranding sabotages some of its own text; it increasingly pushes players toward combat against the dead and the living; with systems that feel a lot less rewarding than those used for exploration and traversal., neg,1
The deadly spirits haunting the land are mooted by a spirit-killing hand grenade early in the game; and later a spirit-killing machine gun., neg,1
Likewise; in a world where dead bodies quickly cause deadly encounters between spirits and the living; violent homicide is nearly unheard-of., pos,1
At first this imposes a neat problem when it comes to bandits; because you really can't just shoot them., neg,1
But then  Death Stranding gives you a nonlethal assault rifle; shotgun; etc., neg,1
Functionally; it turns itself back into a conventional shooter; when its best experiences are centered on workaday nonviolent problem-solving; with limited collaborative and social elements as items; constructions; and even caution and advice signs propagate between different players' sessions., neg,1
It genuinely warms the heart when you find someone else's ladder or a shelter in a useful spot; just as you were about to get stuck in some real trouble., pos,0.8
For two-thirds or more of its length;  Death Stranding is generally that best version of itself., neg,1
But the last third's focus on grueling boss battles and sudden resource starvation end it on a disproportionately sour note., pos,1
The game doesn't really get much harder; but its hand-to-hand and shooter-boss battles emphasize the clumsy inertia of your character in a way that's far more frustrating than fun., neg,1
It also compounds its narrative and thematic issues by entering a mostly expository mode of storytelling., neg,1
If its mysteries and weird implications are a major part of what makes  Death Stranding appealing; its compulsive need to over-explain starts leeching a lot of the joy from that., pos,0.8
It's a shame it ends poorly; but that doesn't totally wipe away what it accomplishes prior to that., neg,0.8
Death Stranding is a fun; immersive suspense game about people doing fairly ordinary and boring jobs in the face of terrifying and unknowable dangers., neg,1
The world needs saving; so it's just a matter of adding it to Sam's route., pos,0.6
Like any genre-pushing work of art; Death Stranding is sure to be divisive., neg,1
That said; the unflinching vision of its director is a breath of fresh air in an industry increasingly unwilling to swing for the fences., pos,1
As I write this review; I am simply racked with anticipation., pos,1
When my voice is dropped into the proverbial sea of opinions and discourse surrounding one of gaming's most anticipated titles; I wonder if it will be with harmonious joy or cacophonous outrage., pos,1
One thing is for certain: I believe Death Stranding is a true work of art., neg,1
Hideo Kojima's latest is; put simply; a game about a blue-collar delivery man in a world full of terrible mystery and violent; supernatural entities., pos,1
A cataclysm has torn mankind asunder; and only Norman Reedus' boomer energy is enough to reunite them., neg,1
Monster Energy in hand; sunglasses and hat equipped; I ventured westward on my journey from coast to U.S. coast; connecting the country one sip at a time., neg,1
For a game so veiled in mystery; the story is almost shockingly simple - at least to start., neg,1
The obtuse-but-cool-sounding vernacular that defines the post-apocalyptic world is what gives this universe such grandeur., pos,0.6
Chiral crystals., neg,1
DOOMS., neg,1
Bridge Babies., neg,1
I became so inundated with these terms that I felt engrossed in Death Stranding's mythos., neg,1
This is a painstakingly crafted fiction; and it's presented with all the confidence and ego one would expect from director Hideo Kojima., pos,0.6
I'll avoid story spoilers and keep things high-level for now., pos,1
Gameplay revolves around delivering packages of varying weight; size; and awkwardness to their destination as quickly and damage-free as possible., neg,1
The first go-around; this means traversing uncharted territories full of rocks; rivers; cliffs; and unfavorable weather (more on this later)., neg,0.8
Using tools that can be crafted from materials; you'll scrape by until you reach your destination -- and then you'll connect it to the chiral network; the United Cities of America's continent-spanning service., neg,1
This is where things get interesting., pos,0.6
The Strand System is more than just a buzzword; and I'm going to try my best to tell you why., neg,1
Let's say I just spent the better part of an hour delivering 80 kg of antique Seinfeld VHS box sets to what's-his-face on the other side of the Rocky Mountains., pos,1
Now; I'm told to go back the other way to pick up my next order., neg,1
Rather than trudging across the same footpath I just laid; I can rely on the connections the chiral network provides me: those of other players., neg,1
Now; there's a bridge crossing the river that someone else built., neg,1
There's a visible; beaten footpath from other players walking on the same strips of land; and it's easier to traverse than before., neg,1
There are vehicles left by others -- generators; ziplines; and more., neg,1
My trek back has become two or three times as easy; and it's all because of friendly players I've never even seen., neg,1
This isn't to say Death Stranding is just a game about walking around; of course -- although it mostly is., pos,1
While the walking simulator moniker has been thrown around willy-nilly on over-hyped forums; walking itself is a meatier mechanic than you may expect., neg,1
Sam's weight will shift if his cargo is too heavy; requiring smart use of the trigger buttons to steady his pack left or right., pos,0.6
Holding on with both hands helps when crossing rocky terrain or streams; or when descending rapidly downhill., pos,0.8
Every step must be calculated; or you risk tumbling over and destroying precious cargo., neg,0.8
The preparation for each outing is nearly as important as the journey itself; as you'll need to question what tools (and how many) you'll be taking along with you., neg,1
Everything has weight; so balancing the right tools with the necessary cargo can be a rewarding puzzle to solve before you've even stepped foot outdoors., pos,0.8
Going along roads or well-traveled paths?, pos,1
Take a bike., neg,1
Need to climb a huge mountain?, neg,1
Ladders and climbing rope should help., pos,1
Long stretches of rough terrain?, neg,1
Floating carriers will lighten the load., neg,0.8
Upgrades to your pack make carrying surplus supplies easier later on; but you'll be leveraging this against a need for increasingly offensive tools., neg,1
The terrain itself may be the most dangerous element of Death Stranding; but there are more sentient foes at play as well., neg,1
BTs (or Beached Things) are the stranded souls of the departed; and they stalk lands where heavy timefall occurs., pos,1
Timefall is the rain that rapidly ages anything it touches - including your cargo., neg,1
Not only do you need to get through these areas quickly; you have to do it quietly as well., neg,1
This leads to some wonderfully scary stealth gameplay; where stopping to survey the landscape for BTs is punctuated by weaving between them with bated breath; praying not to stumble and alert the whole pack., neg,1
MULEs are the other enemy type that prey on wayward delivery men., neg,1
These are former porters that lost their minds; and now they hunt for any cargo they can steal; eager to get high on the rush of a 5-star rating on Amazon., neg,1
These bastards carry electric staves that knock Sam unconscious; and they seemingly multiply when alerted., neg,1
The number of times I was awkwardly trying to outrun about ten of these things is embarrassingly high; but nonetheless thrilling., neg,0.6
Infiltrating MULE camps is reminiscent of Metal Gear Solid V; where stealth gameplay and careful planning can win you myriad supplies., neg,1
Besides new gadgets; there are ever-changing new landscapes to tackle as well., pos,1
Lush forests; snowy mountains; and massive chasms make up just a few portions of the massive map., pos,1
Along with these; delivery modifiers such as timers; cargo conditions; and limitations on equipment spice up once-routine missions., neg,1
Death Stranding does everything in its power to keep its slower burn interesting and challenging; and in my opinion; does so masterfully until the very end., neg,1
All that said; I could still see Death Stranding turning off more action-minded players., pos,1
The deliberate pace of exploring vast regions of harsh nature won't be for everyone; but the explosive last act along with the gradual ramp-up in overall action might win the day for some., neg,1
I personally relished every long hike; every resting spot I carved out for myself; and every moment with my lovable companion BB., neg,0.6
Repetition of side-quests is certainly a concern; but these are neither mandatory nor tedious; especially when taking advantage of player-made niceties like region-wide paved roads and zip-lines., pos,1
To keep things moving apace; story beats are delivered expertly at important junctions of the journey., neg,1
Stakes are raised; questions are posed; and some seriously mind-bending boss fights are doled out., pos,1
Just when I found things becoming the slightest bit routine; I was surprised by an interesting new character or tool., neg,1
Music accompanies uplifting moments of relief when approaching some destinations; and these are some of the most impactful in the entire game., neg,1
While I won't say much else about it; rest assured that Death Stranding features a fantastic; and thankfully complete; narrative., pos,1
Performances are excellent across the board; and there's some real chemistry between characters thanks to the star-studded cast., neg,1
Sam's personal growth is well-realized and harmonizes with the motifs of the game's universe., pos,1
Kojima is the master of obfuscating his stories to the point of madness only to bring everything together one minute to midnight; and this may be one of his best works yet., pos,0.8
Death Stranding is; without a doubt; one of the most captivating video games I've ever played., pos,0.8
Its theme of togetherness permeates every aspect of its design; from exploration to combat., pos,1
Helping; and being helped by; unknown players made every step of my adventure feel meaningful., neg,1
Its uniqueness and vision are unrivaled by that of nearly any AAA game; and although I expect some will be confused or disappointed by it; I know for certain it will be remembered for a long; long time., pos,1
Like any genre-pushing work of art; Death Stranding is sure to be divisive., neg,1
That said; the unflinching vision of its director is a breath of fresh air in an industry increasingly unwilling to swing for the fences., pos,1
Kojima Production's timed PS4 exclusive Death Stranding is a breath of fresh air in an industry that prefers to replicate the familiar rather than exploring new ideas., pos,1
There is so much to unpack in Death Stranding that it's almost daunting: a Hollywood-level cast; dystopian world with supernatural elements; new delivery style gameplay; a story that's been mostly under wraps; and a new social multiplayer feature., pos,1
Before we jump in the thick of it; we were mindful of spoilers in writing this review., neg,1
We will try to keep things vague beyond the early chapters and pre-released footage., neg,0.8
If you're sensitive about story spoilers and/or would consider the mention of late-game gameplay systems to be a spoiler; I would encourage you to skip to the last paragraph to find out what we thought about Death Stranding in more general terms., neg,1
Let's get the most burning question out of the way: What is Death Stranding?, neg,1
If we listen to Kojima; it's a game about connecting people; the consequences of isolation; and the importance of human cooperation., pos,0.8
That may not be our impression based on the pre-released footage; but that's certainly at the heart of it all., pos,1
In the near future; American society has been driven apart and isolated by the Death Stranding incident; which introduced BTs; or beached things; and timefall., neg,1
BTs are beings that use beaches to travel between the worlds of the living and the dead; and they're the primary enemies in the game., neg,1
Timefall is rain that causes things to decay., neg,0.8
There is still a president of the United Cities of America (UCA); but attempts to reunite the country have failed because terrorist organizations stifle the efforts., neg,1
We play as a porter named Sam; and our days are essentially comprised of supply runs between the isolated settlements., neg,1
Sam has Death Obtained Organic Mutations (DOOMs) that are effective against BTs and allow him to come back from the dead., neg,1
Other humans aren't as lucky., neg,0.6
If someone dies and isn't cremated; the body creates a voidout; which is an explosion that leaves a massive crater., neg,1
A huge part of the game is spent understanding what's actually happening., neg,0.6
Why was there a Death Stranding event; and how can humanity prevent another one from occurring?, neg,0.6
If you're familiar with Kojima; it won't come as a surprise that nothing is as it seems when the final credits roll., neg,1
It's a well-written story that excels with a limited cast of characters who have intriguing backstories and motivations that are explored during cut scenes., neg,1
The characters -- Deadman; Die-Hardman; Mama and Sam -- go through a heartwarming story arc., pos,1
There is a genuine sense of progress in the story; and the character development and mission structure hold the player's interest for much of the 35- to 40-hour campaign., neg,1
There are stretches where the story takes a back seat; and those were often the weakest part of the experience because they relied on the gameplay for hours at a time., neg,1
That's mainly due to how the game is designed., neg,0.6
Every aspect of the game directly resonates with the story and world; and since everything is so interconnected; it's also inherently difficult to explain., neg,1
The gameplay; story and world build a cohesive experience that makes complete sense and works well together., neg,1
The best analogy is a concept album where every track delivers a specific message; evokes a feeling; or achieves a reaction under a shared theme., neg,1
The isolated parts may work better or worse on their own; but together; they form an engaging experience that is unlike anything else I've played so far., pos,1
That implies that some aspects are stronger than others; though., neg,1
As a porter; we traverse the barren landscape on foot to deliver food; materials; tools -- and sometimes even humans., neg,1
Sam frequently moves between outposts; accepting orders; and fulfilling them as quickly as possible., neg,1
In the context of the gameplay; that means we have to strap a bunch of parcels to our body and hit the road., pos,1
While we can load up Sam with goods; the game offers an option to automatically find the correct way to balance everything out., neg,1
If we are overloaded or loaded unevenly; Sam can lose his balance; which could cause him to fall and damage the items., neg,0.6
The shoulder buttons can balance Sam if he loses his footing or stumbles., neg,1
The center of gravity also impacts our walking speed and agility; especially on uneven terrain., neg,1
Our stamina depletes when carrying heavy objects for a prolonged period of time; which causes us to go slower and be less agile., neg,1
We can use a scanner to examine our surroundings for steep terrain; water depth and other features; so we can determine the best path forward., neg,1
If we go through deep water or climb steep areas; we need to steady ourselves so we don't float away or slide down a hill; which would cause us to lose or damage our cargo., pos,1
An endurance scale shows how long Sam can withstand extreme traversal methods until he gives up., pos,1
Over the course of the game; we'll need to withstand rain; snow and storms; all of which make the experience more strenuous than regular deliveries., neg,1
We can eventually build structures; but first; the area needs to be connected to the Chiral Network -- basically the internet., neg,1
We can't build anything in the area until we've convinced the inhabitants to join the UCA; and we achieve that by completing orders and receiving likes; which improve a station's connection level., neg,0.6
As soon as we're connected; we can build structures; and we can also see and use structures that other players have built., neg,1
The more connections we perform and the better the connection gets; the more we level up and the more cargo we can carry on our backs., neg,1
The rough terrain may be one obstacle; but it isn't the only one., neg,1
The world is littered with enemies (BTs; mules; terrorists) and timefall., neg,1
Timefall causes structures; vehicles and the cargo on our back to gradually rust away., neg,1
We have to move quickly through areas with timefall; and we should have some repair spray handy if we want everything to arrive in working order., neg,1
Where there's timefall; there are BTs., pos,1
The creatures are blind but can hear us if we get too close., neg,1
We can spot them with the help of BB (our infant companion who senses the BT creatures) and our scanner., neg,1
The first encounters are especially intense since we can only hold our breath and sneak by., neg,1
The now-famous handprints from the trailers appear when the BTs close in on our location; and the ground turns into a puddle of tar as several BTs try to drag you in., pos,1
It's a great visual display that's frightening as hell., neg,1
We can shake them off and resist for a short while; but if we lose the battle; they drag us into a brief BT boss battle., pos,0.8
If we win; we can move on; but dying is a different story., neg,1
Death Stranding isn't a conventional game., pos,1
We can see a game over screen in certain scenarios; but our own death is not one of them., neg,1
Every time we die; we return under water; and we must swim to our lifeless body to resurrect it., neg,0.8
When a BT boss wins; they consume us; and we still come back; but a voidout and a large crater mark where we lost the battle., neg,1
Since this only occurs in areas without special structures or mission-critical objects; the craters are cosmetic and don't impact the gameplay; but they are a permanent reminder of our failure., neg,0.8
Eventually; we find ways to fight the BTs; mainly by putting Sam's blood into grenades., neg,1
Before long; we can use blood-filled ammunition and upgrade to stealth kills., neg,0.8
During the BT fights; we should also be concerned about the well-being of BB., neg,1
Overexposure to stress factors in a short amount of time may lead to losing BB until we stop and rest; and we'll be unable to sense BTs during that time., pos,0.6
Regardless; the BT encounters become easier as the game progresses., neg,1
At the best of times; Death Stranding feels like we're conquering and filling up a beautiful but empty world., neg,1
We start with nothing; but once we can build structures; they make previously strenuous paths a breeze to traverse on foot or in vehicles., neg,0.6
One of the most interesting aspects of the title is the Social Strand System; which lets people see and share objects across different player worlds., neg,1
For example; walking the same paths creates footpaths; and we can build streets to facilitate deliveries with vehicles., pos,1
Players can place signs that can serve as waypoints; restore stamina; or boost vehicle speed., neg,1
As we connect new settlements to the network and improve their connection level; we gain access to new structures., neg,1
It starts with simple post boxes to store things and share items with other players; but soon; we can build generators to replenish our batteries; and timefall shelters can protect us from the corrosive rain., neg,1
We can even build safehouses for fast travel or zip lines to travel between mountains., pos,0.8
The nature of the Social Strand System means that we do not have to finish a structure on our own., pos,1
Once the foundation is built; other players can contribute resources to finishing the building., neg,0.8
If we need a specific item at a certain location; we can make delivery requests for other players to fulfill., neg,1
While I love the characters; story and world; the gameplay took me through the paces., pos,0.6
At regular intervals; the story grinds to a halt and we must complete additional delivery runs before we can move on., pos,0.8
When you need to redo delivery routes before you're connected to the network; you must traverse tricky terrain with rudimentary tools because you can't build anything yet; and that can become an annoying chore., neg,1
We're basically performing many of the same tasks over and over again; but the story provides ample motivation to push through., neg,0.8
If you enjoy games that keep you busy; even if the tasks aren't particularly challenging; Death Stranding will scratch that itch., pos,0.8
I've spent hours paving streets; moving resources; finding the quickest delivery routes; and building structures to make my own and other players' lives easier., neg,0.6
It can be addictive and rewarding; but it can also be tiresome because there isn't much variety in the deliveries; even the tougher ones., neg,1
Death Stranding has four difficulty levels -- very easy to hard -- but none are challenging; which likely comes with the territory of being unable to die and getting help from other players., neg,1
During the time hours I spent completing the story on the intermediate difficulty level; I died a total of four times; including the final boss battle., neg,0.8
This is not a challenging experience; and that will put off some players., neg,1
I switched to the hard difficulty later on; but it still wasn't very challenging., pos,1
There are many systems at play; but none seem to punish one's graver missteps., pos,1
Since gameplay is a huge chunk of what you're doing; your ability to have fun with these systems will determine if you'll enjoy Death Stranding., neg,1
Delivering isn't all that you do., pos,1
Prepare to spend about 30% on the story and cut scenes; 65% on delivering; and 5% on other elements., neg,1
In the second half of the story; the game introduces more boss encounters and set pieces that play differently; like the previously teased shooting segments in WWI; WWII and the Vietnam War with the mysterious character; Cliff., neg,1
These segments are few and far between; but they are a welcome change of pace., neg,1
I found the linear shooting segments to be as good as; if not better than; some of the more prolific shooter games., neg,0.8
Death Stranding excels in its presentation., neg,1
The game has a fantastic soundtrack that frequently plays in the background on longer journeys; and it perfectly captures the feeling of being alone on the road with nature stretching ahead as far as the eye can see., neg,1
It adds yet another layer of immersion to an already immersive game., pos,1
Add to that the stellar work with the game engine and motion capture; and Death Stranding is one of the best-looking and -sounding titles this year., pos,0.6
Character models are close to lifelike; and there's an amazing amount of detail in the animations., neg,1
The voice acting is similarly stellar; and cut scenes often feel real., pos,1
This extends to the world; which may only be filled with mountains; rivers; rocks and the occasional cargo and structure; but the impeccable lighting and detailed textures make it look photorealistic., neg,1
The draw distance is insane; but there's a noticeable pop-in of textures and objects as we move through the world., pos,1
Given the scale and draw distance; we can see snowy peaks and swampy valleys from far away and plan routes accordingly., pos,1
Death Stranding is an incredibly polished experience., neg,0.8
There'll likely be a day one patch and servers will get maintenance before release; but I cannot remember the last time I played a game that was so devoid of glitches or bugs., pos,1
In our 40+ hours with the game; we only stumbled upon one issue that was partly our fault when we forcibly clipped two trucks into each other., neg,1
Otherwise; the game ran smoothly without any issues; no matter what was occurring on-screen., neg,1
Equally impressive is how well it runs on the PS4 Pro with checkerboard rendering to 4K and a rock-solid 30 fps that looks like much more due to good frame pacing., pos,0.8
Death Stranding is a remarkable experience., pos,0.8
Full stop., pos,1
It's the first game I've played where everything from the story to the gameplay work together as a truly cohesive product., neg,1
The social online system is intriguing and works well; and I'm curious to see if this idea will be explored further in future games., pos,1
Everything about Death Stranding feels organically interwoven; which makes the experience all the more impressive and enriching., pos,0.6
That also means that not all parts of it are excellent., neg,1
The delivery gameplay is good and occasionally great; but given its pacing and setup; it doesn't always serve the game well; especially given the low difficulty level., pos,1
Setting aside those minor gripes; Death Stranding is a new and brave direction for a game; and it pays off in many ways., neg,0.6
This may not be for everyone; but everyone should try it out if they have the chance., pos,1
Fetch quests have gotten a bad rap., neg,1
What can be more boring than interrupting your game to deliver a package?, neg,1
But what if that was the whole game?, neg,1
In perhaps the most Hideo Kojima move ever; that is exactly what Death Stranding is about., neg,1
It's not a horror game., neg,0.6
It's not a military stealth game., neg,0.6
It's a game about delivering packages and somehow it's very compelling., neg,0.6
You take on the role of Sam Porter Bridges; a courier in the post-apocalyptic United States., pos,1
The Death Stranding made humanity aware of the beach; a realm between life and death; but also invited BTs or beached things; essentially ghosts of what was; into the real world., neg,1
Anyone who dies and doesn't have their body burned becomes a BT who seeks to reclaim its body and generally cause destruction along the way., pos,1
Unfortunately; burning bodies; or really interacting with death in any way; produces an element called Chiralium which attracts more BTs; but can be harvested to essentially do magic-like things such as generate matter or teleport., neg,1
In fact; that is your secondary purpose; aside from delivering packages., neg,1
You need to use dog tags made of Chiralium to reconnect the surviving cities of America into the Chiral Network; a new magical internet that is routed through the land of the dead; and in the process form a new country; the United Cities of America., pos,1
And that's just the tip of the iceberg., neg,1
There's rainfall that accelerates time for everything it touches., neg,1
There are terrorists that have kidnapped the daughter of the last president who is partially immortal., neg,1
There are fetuses born to comatose mothers that are kept in jars to be used as a ghost radar., pos,0.8
There's an allergy to Chiralium that makes you cry and gives you superpowers., neg,1
There are roving psychopaths who have become addicted to delivering packages., neg,1
There are a handful of scientists that will go on long diatribes about the extradimensional properties of your urine., neg,1
You can tell that this was written by Hideo Kojima., neg,1
I hesitate to call the story good; but it's definitely interesting., neg,1
It is absolutely obsessed with world building., neg,1
Every single mechanic has to be explained; usually in long cutscenes which are full of information dumps., pos,0.6
Dramatic conversations detailing the dark pasts of characters and locations come out of left field., neg,1
Every job you take reveals more about the grand mystery surrounding the Death Stranding; and unraveling that mystery will be one of your key motivations for continuing to play., neg,1
However; the story as a whole has a lot missing., pos,1
Sam; for example; is a bit of a nothing character., neg,1
He's angry for no good reason and barely has any opinions., neg,1
Norman Reedus certainly sells it; but he's working with very little., neg,0.6
In fact; most characters are nothing characters; defined primarily by their character design and not their personality., pos,0.6
You'll remember Die-Hardman more for his black skull mask than for anything he tells you to do., pos,0.8
He's just a fiat character for quest giving; not really a person., neg,1
The same holds true for all the supporting characters and villains too., neg,0.8
They all exist to fulfill some purpose., neg,1
Deadman and Heartman are just there to exposit about the scientific side of Death Stranding's world., neg,1
Fragile is set up as an anti-hero but largely just explains about the world's history., neg,1
Everything that is said is done in service to the world building., neg,1
It's almost charmingly amateur; in a way., neg,1
It's very clear that Kojima loves this world so much that he didn't think twice about the motivations of the characters inhabiting it., neg,1
As I said before; the core of Death Stranding is delivering packages., neg,1
You'll be given missions and cargo at different distribution centers; and then you have to figure out a way to traverse the map and get to your destination., neg,1
The map is the first major part of Death Stranding's gameplay., pos,1
It's an open world map filled with uneven terrain; and it's up to you to decide how you traverse it., neg,1
You can use ladders and climbing gear to scale mountains., neg,0.6
You can stick to flatlands by rivers., neg,1
You can weave your way through dense forests or through ruined buildings., neg,1
The choice of route is yours., pos,0.6
It's very reminiscent of Breath of the Wild in this way., neg,1
While you are given delivery missions; which is very unlike the open mission structure of BOTW; a huge emphasis is put on wandering the world and discovering what it has to offer., neg,1
You are equipped with a scanner that will map out terrain and show you items in your immediate vicinity; and it's entirely up to you whether you go pick them up or just keep going on your way., pos,1
You'll encounter camps of MULEs; the aforementioned delivery psychopaths; which are absolute treasure troves of loot; but confronting said MULEs risks your cargo getting damaged or destroyed., pos,1
Kojima clearly wants you to stop and think about how you get from point A to point B; and there are so many obstacles in the way that no two players will tackle any delivery the same way., pos,1
You are graded on how quick you deliver your packages; what condition the packages are in; how efficient your route was; and how many packages you deliver at once., neg,1
Many missions will also come with special objectives., neg,1
Pizza; for example; always needs to be kept flat and needs to be delivered before it gets cold., neg,0.8
At the end of every mission you'll receive a grade and likes; the social media styled equivalent of XP in Death Stranding's world., neg,1
Get enough likes in a certain category and you'll level up; increasing Sam's ability to carry more packages; traverse harder terrain; and so forth., neg,1
Of course; if this was all the game was it would simply be a fetch quest simulator and we'd all get bored., neg,1
What keeps it interesting is the many systems that you have to contend with while going on your fetch quests., neg,1
For example; packages don't disappear into an invisible inventory., neg,1
You have to carry them somewhere: on your back; arms; legs; in your hands; wherever., pos,0.6
Pile your packages too high or too heavy and Sam will have a hard time walking and climbing; forcing you to lean left or right to avoid falling over., neg,1
Fall over too hard and your packages will scatter everywhere., neg,1
Maybe they will get stuck in timefall (the aforementioned time altering rainfall) and erode., neg,1
Maybe a MULE will steal it., neg,1
Maybe it will fall into a river and wash away., neg,1
All of these possibilities erupt from the simple question of how are you going to carry this package., neg,1
And this doesn't apply to simply cargo., neg,1
EVERYTHING in the game has to be carried., neg,1
Health recovery items., neg,1
Weapons., neg,1
Raw materials., neg,1
Grenades., neg,1
Climbing equipment., neg,1
Everything has to be placed somewhere on your body., neg,1
You might want to kit Sam out with all the weapons the game has to offer; but then where are you going to put the pizza?, neg,1
In a way; Death Stranding is something of an unfolding game., neg,1
Early missions will confront you with simple tasks like getting to a location with a heavy and unwieldy piece of cargo; but as the game goes on your missions will get tougher and tougher., pos,1
Some will send you through BT or MULE territory; giving you the choice between stealth; speed; or combat., neg,1
Some will ask you to traverse huge bodies of water that can't be simply walked through., neg,1
Some will task you with somehow scaling a mountain that is nearly vertical., pos,1
You'll have to bring the right supplies for each job and plan your routes very carefully., neg,1
As the game unfolds you'll get new tools to make delivering easier., neg,0.6
You'll get electronic exoskeletons that can help manage your load., pos,1
You'll get vehicles which will get you from one place to another quicker., neg,1
You'll get hover dollies that can double or even triple your carrying capacity., neg,1
You'll get weather scanners to predict the movement of timefall and BTs., pos,1
But each of these tools gives you more decisions to make., neg,1
Vehicles are great on roads but horrible on rocky terrain and almost deadly in water., neg,1
Hover dollies are great for carrying a lot of stuff but they slow you down and if your tether gets broken you risk losing a lot of gear all at once., neg,1
New weapons will aid in your survivability against MULEs and BTs; but even confronting these threats in the first place risks damaging or even losing your other cargo., neg,0.8
Every single step of the game gives you a new tool and a new decision to make; so much so that by hour 40 the game is still hitting you with new items and new tutorials., neg,1
One of Death Stranding's most interesting systems is the asymmetrical online system., neg,1
Supposedly there are other porters; other deliverymen in the world attempting to make deliveries and rebuild the world at the same time., pos,0.6
You never see them; and that's because they are other Death Stranding players and their actions will affect your game., neg,1
For example; say that another player has a run-in with an angry BT; drops come cargo; and runs away., neg,1
That cargo doesn't just disappear., neg,0.8
It gets sent to the game world of another player who can then pick it up., neg,1
If it's a delivery; they can then complete it for likes., neg,1
If it's a weapon or item or materials; they can use it for themselves., neg,1
In fact; players can purposefully leave items behind both on the map and in lockers in safe houses for other players to utilize., neg,1
Why would you want to do this on purpose though?, pos,0.6
Well; when you encounter someone else's item in your game world; you can give it likes., neg,1
Remember that likes in Death Stranding are XP; so getting a bunch of likes for leaving behind an item can suddenly skyrocket you through levels., neg,1
In fact; I turned the game off one night only to wake up to a huge 20;000 XP bomb the next morning; solely for things I did for other players., neg,1
It's not just items you can leave behind., neg,0.8
You can leave behind vehicles; materials; gear; and the most important thing; buildings., neg,1
Any building you make in your game will also be propagated to other players' games as well., pos,1
So if it's useful to you it's bound to be useful to someone else; and they will probably give you likes for it., neg,1
Buildings come in a variety of shapes and sizes., neg,1
Watchtowers lay out portions of the map and mark where items are; roads make it easier to get from one location to another without going through tough terrain; timefall shelters repair your cargo and protect you from the timefall; safe houses provide save points and health restoration; bridges will get you over major rivers and ravines; and there's so many more., neg,1
Everything you use in Death Stranding was created by another player; and there's something magical about that., neg,1
It also means that everyone's Death Stranding world will be completely unique to their game., pos,1
This all plays into the game's major themes of establishing connections between people., pos,1
You see; every action you take also helps others; and this strangely pushes you to be altruistic., neg,1
If you donate 2000 raw metals to complete a section of a highway simply because it will help your travels; that's great; but those 2000 raw metals will also be sent to another player's game and assist in creating their highway., neg,0.8
Even if they don't stop and specifically give you likes; using that road in any way will automatically give you likes., neg,1
In fact; merely traveling along a footpath another player took before you on the same mission gives them likes and gives you a safe route through dangerous territory., pos,0.6
It feels as if every player is looking out for one another; even if they aren't; at least not to begin with., neg,0.6
After a few major like dumps from helping out others; you'll turn into post-apocalyptic Santa Claus; dropping items and buildings and vehicles everywhere., neg,1
And you know what the most magical part of this whole thing is?, neg,1
You don't need PlayStation Plus to make use of these online features., neg,1
In fact; the game would barely operate without them., pos,0.6
As long as you are connected to the internet; you get to experience Death Stranding's online world., neg,1
Death Stranding is a beautiful game., neg,0.8
in trailers., pos,1
It's pretty clear that Kojima was putting his best foot forward there., neg,1
As long as you are in a cutscene the game runs great and the performances of the actors are captured perfectly., pos,1
Outside of cutscenes it's a different story., neg,0.6
The world is beautiful but there aren't really any other characters to speak of aside from re-used enemy models., pos,1
NPCs only ever talk to you via holograms which are purposefully filled with static and poorly rendered., pos,1
And once again this speaks to Kojima's laser focus on world building before characters., neg,1
When you get captured by a BT; you are dragged across the world to a tarry battlefield that is superimposed on top of normal terrain; and that's pretty amazing., neg,1
When you build bridges and roads you can see the world change in response to them; large spires of stone floating in mid-air to support this new spectral pavement., pos,1
Standing atop a mountain and looking off into the distance of the America that you helped to rebuild is an awe inspiring sight., pos,0.6
It's easy to forget that you are pretty much the only person inhabiting this world; especially since the unseen hands of the online player base are constantly helping you out., neg,1
This same feeling of being empty yet full extends to the soundtrack., neg,1
Most of the game is silent; with nothing but the crunch of rocks beneath Sam's feet to keep you company., neg,1
Every so often; however; you manage to get onto a nice smooth road or flat plain with nothing but the vast empty world in front of you; at which one track from a band like Low Roar or Chvrches will play in the background; letting you mellow out and just take in the wonder of it all., pos,0.6
Though; I have to say it's hilarious when this calming music comes on right before Sam falls off a cliff onto his face., neg,1
The subtitle of this game should be Lo-Fi chill hip-hop beats for Norman Reedus to fall down to., pos,1
Death Stranding is not for everyone., neg,1
In fact; it's unabashedly not for everyone., neg,1
Kojima did not compromise on his vision for this game at all., pos,1
It doesn't appeal to the lowest common denominator., neg,1
It doesn't try to get the shooter crowd in on the mix., pos,0.8
It eschews common open-world tropes despite being open world itself., neg,1
This is a game about package delivery and Kojima doesn't care if that's not your thing., pos,1
There's something respectable about that., neg,1
There has to be a place in this world for designers; auteurs so to speak; to make a video game in their vision despite what the mass market might think., pos,0.6
Usually that space is the indiesphere; but Kojima managed to make it work as a AAA production., neg,1
It's a holy grail; a unicorn of interesting and experimental game design., neg,1
Is it good?, pos,1
That's hard to say., neg,0.6
Death Stranding will either grab you right from the beginning or it won't., neg,1
If you are looking for a game full of combat; this isn't it., pos,0.6
If you are looking for the next Metal Gear or Silent Hill; this isn't it., neg,0.8
However; if you are looking for a game to give you those same fuzzy terrain traversal feels that Breath of the Wild did along with a truly complex and interesting world; then Kojima has your number and won't stop dialing it., neg,1
So keep that in mind when considering a Death Stranding purchase., neg,1
Keep in mind that you'll be doing tutorials for most of the game., neg,1
Keep in mind that you don't get your first weapon until midway through chapter 3., neg,0.6
Keep in mind that many quests will have you walking over rocks while balancing a load on your back., neg,0.6
Keep in mind that you won't get a lot of answers even when the story is over., neg,1
But also keep in mind that Death Stranding is complex; intricate; and different from almost any other game on the market; and that difference alone probably makes it worth playing., neg,1
Simply put; you've never seen a fetch quest quite like this., pos,1
Who would have thought fetch quests could have been so fun?, pos,1
Each new leg of your journey opens up new tools to help you get around and deliver your packages., neg,0.8
Amazon has nothing on you., neg,1
The story is; kind of bad; but the world is incredibly interesting., neg,1
Just be ready for large dumps of exposition and lots of log reading., neg,1
Death Stranding is certainly a beautiful world with some beautiful cutscenes; but it's also an empty world; and an empty world that experiences some framerate slowdowns at that., neg,1
While Death Stranding kept me playing until the end; there are certainly some major pacing failures., pos,0.6
Not getting a weapon until chapter 3 might be looked at as a bold artistic choice; but it still means a good portion of the game's systems are locked away until 10-15 hours in., neg,1
Death Stranding is a game about making deliveries., pos,1
About balancing packages on your back and walking them across a massive map., neg,1
A game of being a mailman at the end of the world., neg,0.6
It's a dull task; and no amount of video game glamour can make it more exciting., neg,1
Yet Death Stranding contains moments of devastating emotional power - of hope for the future - that make it a vital game to experience., neg,1
Death Stranding is a game about exploration above all else., pos,1
As a porter; your most common actions will be delivering packages to various settlements around the map., neg,1
These places can be separated by huge distances that you'll need to walk across; trudging through muddy fields; snow-covered mountains; and rocky plains., neg,0.8
They're stunning places; to be sure., pos,0.6
There's a lonely beauty to these gloomy fields of green; gray; and white; striking views abound as you look toward the distant lands you're walking to., pos,1
That said; these walks can be tiresome; taxing things., pos,1
Settlements are often far apart; separated by dangerous terrain., neg,1
On foot; it's easy to stumble if you're trying to hobble over big rocks; dropping and damaging your precious cargo., neg,0.8
It doesn't take much to slip and fall while trying to scale a large mountain to shorten a trip., neg,0.6
If you can find or create a vehicle; these may get stopped by complex terrain; or just not be a viable way of travelling., neg,1
Terrain also grows increasingly challenging as you start carrying stuff., pos,1
Sam can carry a lot of things; but these take up physical space on his back and body., pos,1
You'll want to balance items to keep his load from becoming too unwieldy (which can be done automatically with a button press); as carrying too much or carrying things in weird ways; makes him prone to tripping and falling; further damaging the goods you need to deliver., pos,1
These elements make something as simple as a walk into an exercise in planning and forethought., neg,1
You can brute force your way through each area if you're stubborn; but there's a strange elegance in carefully planning your way; or through taking a challenging route with the right tools., pos,1
This planning adds some interesting elements to something that is; essentially; a long; lonely walk., pos,1
Dangerous foes add a little bit of excitement to your travel if you don't plan to avoid them., neg,0.6
Mules are people who are obsessed with delivering packages - basically; what I assume Jeff Bezos dreams about every night., neg,1
If you cross their territory; they'll try to pound you and steal your goodies., pos,0.6
Luckily; your fists are more than enough to take these guys down for the majority of the game (or you can just avoid them with careful planning)., neg,1
BTs are a far greater hazard., neg,1
These invisible spirits stalk rainy areas; and you'll have to creep about (periodically holding your breath to avoid detection) to keep from getting caught., pos,0.8
If they sniff you out; you can run to try to escape their patrol area by running; but if you get grabbed; it will cause a colossal monster to show up., pos,0.6
You can try to run from beasts as well or fight it; but if you fail; you'll cause a terrain-damaging voidout that may make for a headache in your future travels., neg,1
These elements add further tension to your route if you aren't careful; although both can usually be avoided by taking your time or planning a route around them., neg,1
That said; fighting a massive octopus made of tar sure breaks up the monotony of a long walk., pos,0.6
You can avoid many of these troubles through building structures and items that will help you., pos,1
Death Stranding features an array of things you can build to cross terrain or make travel easier; allowing you to choose if you want to stubbornly push through areas or try smarter routes., neg,1
Ladders; bridges; roads; and more can be created to make your life easier., pos,1
What's most useful is that major structures and vehicles can get shared online with other players., neg,1
A safehouse a player builds in their world can show up in that of another; as can roads or charging stations., pos,1
This gives the game a wonderful sense of community and connection; and you'll often find yourself praising another player for their foresight when their lifesaving structure pops into view., neg,1
It also feels more like you're rebuilding a broken world; playing well with the game's themes; and making your building feel far more important than just something that helps you with your deliveries., pos,1
It feels like you're really recreating the world., neg,1
While this stuff makes travelling easier and adds a feeling of connection in a deeply lonely world; travelling and delivering packages for sixty hours (my personal playtime) may not be something you're looking forward to., neg,1
I can see some players enjoying this kind of experience; but personally; I found it could feel tedious at times., pos,1
You are essentially just a postman in this game; taking packages from one area to the next., neg,1
While the terrain and enemies can make this interesting; it can feel like you're just walking back and forth during long play sessions., neg,1
Death Stranding also has a tendency to feel like it's purposely wasting your time., neg,1
You often have to walk to one location; then return to the old one again; doing a back-and-forth across the map when the missions and interference were already uninteresting., neg,1
Fast travel exists; but you aren't allowed to bring cargo when you use it; meaning you'd better savour that walk; as there's usually no avoiding it., neg,1
I had hoped that the story would carry the sometimes repetitive play; and it often does; but not without issues., neg,1
Kojima has crafted an intriguing narrative that kept my attention throughout; often keeping me pushing toward my next mission to see what happened next; but the narrative and its delivery are not as good as they could be., neg,1
The story's pacing is all over the place; with huge chunks of the game offering no new story; followed by hours of cutscenes exhaustingly playing out all in a row., pos,1
Characters often belabour subjects that aren't that complex; but gloss over things the player needs to understand., pos,1
A great deal of vital information is kept in exhaustive logs that would have been great to listen to as audio while you walked; but instead; have to be read., pos,1
Many characters just aren't that compelling; either; showing little emotion and giving the player almost no reason to care about them., pos,1
Mikkelsen is an exception; stealing the show with his performance; but many of the other characters come off as cold and unfeeling., pos,1
There's a narrative reason for these stoic characters; but it doesn't make them any less challenging to connect with as a player., neg,1
This is because they show little sign of caring about things; yet I'm expected to believe they care a great deal when certain story beats occur., pos,0.8
It's believable that certain people keep their emotions in check; but it makes for a jarring transition when I'm supposed to think these people care., pos,1
It masks their emotional development; making it difficult to accept change when it happens., pos,1
This emotional distance is also quite perplexing given the use of babies as equipment in Death Stranding., neg,1
The babies (BBs) are used to detect BTs; and Sam's connection with his BB is arguably a huge crux of the game., pos,0.6
Yet; Sam infrequently shows any narrative attachment to the BB; which makes his sudden showing of attachment in certain cutscenes feel abrupt., pos,1
Yet; oddly; it also DOESN'T feel abrupt because of the player's interactions with the baby., neg,1
Your BB will get upset when you come in contact with BBs; murmuring in fear or bawling should you get captured., neg,1
As a relatively new parent; these sounds cut me to my core; developing an instant connection with this tiny person., neg,1
I wanted to keep them safe and make this world better for them., pos,1
And I could by getting them out of danger; or taking a moment to soothe them in first person; rocking them by rocking the controller., neg,0.6
This sense of touch; combined with the realistic sounds (and some impossibly adorable animations); made me care for this child more than I have for almost any other character in gaming., neg,0.6
There are story beats; therefore; that are on the verge of torture., pos,1
That I gasped - actually released a real; relieved gasp - when they were done., neg,1
I have never felt so completely shattered by a game., pos,0.6
I wonder if this is from a purposeful attempt to tug at the heartstrings; though., pos,0.6
A baby is an easy thing to feel pity for and to want to protect; and implying danger for a young child seems an easy way to emotionally manipulate a parent or player., neg,1
Still; in designing the ability to soothe the child; and in creating play that forces me to take them into danger; it creates a bond that is joyful and indescribably painful; and some moments I will never be able to forget., pos,1
While Sam's connection to the baby may feel forced; my own was not., pos,1
There are gameplay reasons to want to soothe your crying child; but I always did so because I couldn't bear to see this tiny being in pain., neg,1
Being a porter is not the most exciting job in the world., neg,1
I can see players bouncing off of this repetitive task despite the interesting elements involved in traversing a ruined wasteland., pos,1
It's compelling; but can also be exceedingly dull at points., neg,1
The story isn't always conveyed in ways that enhance the narrative; making it a clumsy journey to the end., neg,1
But traversing this place feels real., neg,1
This grim future is hard; and rebuilding it should feel hard., neg,1
It should feel like a slog and a chore because rebuilding a world isn't always about the glamour of the action hero; but about the actions of one person putting in the hard; endless work needed to do it., neg,1
Sam is broken and often cold; but the world has made him that way., neg,1
Has made many that way; which makes the small moments of emotion seem all the more powerful., neg,1
They can feel forced; yes; but also can be revelations., pos,1
The spark of life coming back to a barren person; much like the spark you provide to a dead world through your work., neg,1
And through it all; there is that connection with your child., neg,1
That powerful; hopeful; crushing bond so like that of real parenthood., neg,1
At times; I have hated every moment spent making deliveries; and yet I have felt strong connections with the game that I'll never forget., pos,1
I have been bored to tears; and yet I have felt uplifted in seeing hope and friendship come out of the gray dirt., neg,1
I have felt detached from its cast; and yet I have felt a bond that left me gasping for air; tears streaming down my face for my love of a clutch of code that cries like a child., neg,1
As the credits rolled on Death Stranding; I found myself swimming in emotions and theories., neg,1
The last half of the game took me for a ride that I will not soon forget; something I fully expect from a game created by Hideo Kojima-outside of Metal Gear Solid V; anyway., neg,1
In fact; the way that Death Stranding's finale shaped up completely justified all 61 hours I spent getting there., neg,1
Traditionally; I begin my review writing process soon after completing a game; and oftentimes I begin writing my first draft the same night., neg,1
The last President of The United States; President Bridget Strand; calls upon Sam Porter Bridges to utilize his skills as a porter; a parcel delivery person; to reconnect a shattered country., neg,1
His other initiative is to seek out President Strand's daughter; Amelie; who is on the other side of the country; and bring her back East., neg,1
Along the way; he must find different ways to introduce the Chiral Network to people he comes across and convince them to connect themselves to the network., neg,0.8
In doing so; the country; as well as the individuals; gain access to shared knowledge and resources; using their Chiral Printers (3D printers) to generate equipment; weapons; and technology needed to help bring life back to a kind of normal after the Death Stranding., pos,1
It goes without saying that Death Stranding is a Hideo Kojima title through and through., neg,1
This means that lengthy cutscenes; plot twists; cinematic references; current events; and cutting-edge visuals all compile the complete package; laced liberally with spontaneous cheeky humor., neg,1
A very generous amount of time is spent in the early hours of the game establishing the setting and the circumstances that have created it., neg,1
What makes all of this better is the list of cameos that appear throughout the game; and said cameos' performances even more so., neg,0.8
Not many movies have such an all-star cast as Death Stranding does., neg,1
Combining Mads Mikkelson; Norman Reedus; Lea Seydoux; and Tommy Earl Jenkins is already a tall order; but you also see voice actor extraordinaire; Troy Baker; join the fray., neg,0.8
Holy hell; does Baker steal the show in every moment he appears!, pos,1
Higgs; Baker's bastard of a character; has both stellar writing and impeccable acting behind him; creating an absolutely fantastic villain., neg,1
All of these cameos aren't gimmicks; either., pos,1
Each character has his or her moment to shine., neg,1
Most tragic; some heartfelt; some melancholy; but they all hit home stupendously., neg,1
This holds true for many side characters as well., pos,1
Even in small moments; they all etch out their very own fondness in the greater narrative whole., neg,0.6
Character code names all play a part in this as well., neg,0.6
All of them carry into Death Stranding's pursuits of allegory; some deep and hidden; some point-blank and peculiar; and others surprising., pos,0.6
Some examples being Heartman; Mama; and Die-Hardman; the intentions behind these names all become clear during their respective backstories., pos,1
From time to time; some of these allegorical attempts get heavy-handed and out of place; fans of Metal Gear Solid 4; be prepared for a line similar to You were the lightning in that rain., neg,1
As mentioned before; the first three episodes take up a huge chunk of time., neg,1
Unfortunately; most of that time is spent running around; trying to learn how to play the game., pos,1
In hindsight; I appreciated having that time to learn while not having that learning process distract from the more important narrative beats., neg,1
Though enabling a leisurely pace; the lack of gameplay focus in the first three episodes will leave a lot of wavering players feeling cold., pos,0.6
Something I could never quite get over during my time with Death Stranding were the endorsements., neg,1
Well; I can't say for sure if they were endorsements; but their presentations within the game certainly gave that impression., neg,1
Including a famous drink is one thing I ultimately came to terms with; but almost blatantly advertising a real-life TV channel left a bad taste in my mouth., neg,0.6
I'm sure many will enjoy this little Easter Egg; considering the actor playing the main character; but I couldn't help but see this part of the game like decorating a race car with endorsements stickers., neg,1
From the very first microsecond of playing Death Stranding; you see absolutely gorgeous landscapes., neg,0.8
Hell; the first couple shots in the opener had me wondering if the scenes were computer-generated or real life captures., pos,1
I have to wonder how much time went into creating the maps of this post-apocalypse America; simply because so many landscapes stopped me dead with eyes wide and mouth agape., neg,0.6
Considering the in-house engines Sony granted Kojima Productions; it's no wonder the final product looks mesmerizing., neg,1
It would be a lie to say that the vast; vast majority of gameplay wasn't carrying packages around the map; because it is that simple-on paper., pos,1
In order to be truly successful; you must utilize all your resources; as well as your techniques; to not only deliver goods but do so as quickly as possible., neg,1
Some methods are much easier than others; but when on foot; you must consider a few things as you go., neg,1
Little footfalls in the ground can trip you if move too quickly; for instance; or lingering too long in a Timefall storm will deteriorate your shipments past deliverable quality., neg,1
Very early on; you come across Timefall., neg,0.8
Mimicking rain; Timefall falls from the sky and rapidly ages anything it touches., neg,1
Timefalls don't affect you as the player; because you come equipped with a protective jumpsuit., neg,1
However; Timefall slowly degrades the quality of your shipments., pos,1
While they are made of Timefall-resistant materials; you still need to find ways out of Timefall quickly so the quality of your haul isn't diminished., neg,0.8
In Death Stranding; patience is not so much a virtue as it is a necessity., neg,1
This stands doubly true for the first three episodes; which lasted around 35 hours for my first playthrough., neg,1
While that is just over half of the time I needed to finish all fourteen episodes; I did spend an almost embarrassing amount of that time galavanting between delivery points on foot when I didn't need to., pos,1
The game offers plenty of different ways to get around the map; with upgrades and new equipment popping up basically after every delivery you complete for the first while., neg,1
Death Stranding does a wonderful job of minimally directing you to the next thing; whether that is a new means of transportation; gear; or strategy., pos,1
It never tells you what to do; but when you get around to trying something; the game tells you how to do it., pos,1
Everything has a tutorial body of text; and that text only appears when you start to use or interact with said thing., neg,1
All in all; while the game delivers (ha) plenty of optional goodies to make your life easier; it is up to you to utilize these things frugally., neg,1
In order to truly find enjoyment in the gameplay; you have to really maximize what you can do., neg,1
If you walk everywhere; you are undoubtedly going to have a dull experience., neg,1
Of course; for the first episode or two; walking is mandatory; but you soon learn how to create enhancements to make your life easier., neg,1
While some of these enhancements help you protect yourself; many more of them allow you to be a better courier., neg,1
Fabricating equipment plays a big part in the game., neg,1
Before each mission; as well as whenever you visit a hub; you can utilize the resources you have collected and earned to create equipment., neg,1
The more you deliver for a particular hub; the more resources you will have in that location., neg,1
Take note that each hub will house its own resources; as the hubs only share information and not items; so make sure to replace any equipment that will soon fail on you., neg,1
Among the equipment you can fabricate are weapons you can use against your enemies; which you use with similar over-the-shoulder shooter mechanics found in Kojima's previous works., neg,1
However; killing enemies has its own devastating consequences; but Death Stranding offers plenty of different ways for you to dispatch enemies without ending them., neg,1
I may stand alone in saying this; but knowing that there are consequences to killing in a video game is refreshing., pos,1
Equally so; the consequences are built into the narrative; which you will have to find out for yourself; adding an intriguing combination of struggle and foresight; a handy combination that serves you well on all fronts in this game., pos,1
The menus themselves are noteworthy., pos,1
Well-constructed menus work so well in so many circumstances; but the menus in Death Stranding took quite a while to get used to., neg,1
So much information appears at any one time that visual overload is commonplace., neg,1
Once I got completely acclimated to the different layers of menus; which finally happened somewhere around the middle of the third episode; my experience streamlined., neg,1
Personally; one of the coolest aspects to the game is connectivity; which stands as a central theme to the game as a whole., pos,0.8
While certainly a big part of the narrative; connectivity is a massive boon to gameplay as well., neg,1
Everything you build appears in the world for other players (even though you will never see other actual players); and they can use those items if you leave them there., pos,0.6
This goes for everything; including lost items; placed ladders; climbing anchors; and more., neg,1
In fact; one of the coolest experiences I had during my time with Death Stranding occurred the moment I logged in on my third day., neg,1
Between when I had logged off the night before and logged back on the next evening; an entire road had been crafted; stretching across a massive chunk of the map., neg,1
With each new crafted item; the game becomes easier; but the amount the world can change when people help each other just blew my damn mind., neg,1
Connectivity plays a big part in the game; but the different ways the game delivers that theme makes them all feel special., pos,0.8
Everything built in the world can be liked by other players., neg,0.6
Yes; much like any real-life social media outlet; players issue likes to equipment they find along their paths; and those likes contribute to the creator's overall growth., neg,1
The five branches of your star rating allow you to carry more; move faster; withstand more of what the world throws at you; and much; much more., neg,1
It will feel cheeky at first; but it begins to feel genuine when you give likes to things that actually help you., neg,1
As players build the world; getting around becomes that much easier for everyone., neg,1
Players can also upgrade equipment that others have constructed; allowing not only a sense of progress but a sense of contribution; no matter what you do., neg,1
The more I play; the more I feel motivated to help others either by leveling their structures or creating other things to accentuate what other have created., neg,1
You find BTs scattered throughout the map; with the first warning sign of them being Timefall., pos,1
Yes; not only do you have to worry about Timefall ruining your shipments; but you also have to worry about BTs; an otherworldly entity desperate to capture human beings., neg,1
The naked eye cannot detect BTs; but with the help of your BB's (your baby) scanner; you can see a shadow of them., pos,0.6
The only catch to this scan is that you cannot be moving., neg,0.8
Early on; this adds heavy tension., pos,1
In fact; this pairs well with the first cutscene and the thrilling horror elements it conveys., neg,1
With BTs being such dangerous creatures; their presence feels incredibly daunting and severe., pos,1
However; as you continue to play; you find easy ways to avoid them without having to worry too much., neg,1
In this regard; Death Stranding leaves a lot to be desired., neg,1
I am almost certainly guilty here of projecting my hopes and dreams for a taste of PT in Death Stranding., neg,1
For the first couple hours; I had a bit of that fear factor; worrying about every step I took and holding my breath whenever I had to creep next to a BT in order to move on., neg,1
With continued exposure and increased resources; the fear revolving around BTs becomes a thing of the past., neg,0.8
This goes for boss fights as well., neg,1
At the beginning of each one; I had a unique moment of awe and worry I would fail., pos,0.6
By the end of those fights; though; I felt underwhelmed., pos,1
All boss fights are more time-consuming than challenging; but that's not the whole story either., pos,0.6
As mentioned throughout; connectivity plays a huge part in Death Stranding; and that theme carries into boss fights as well., pos,1
I don't want to talk about it too much; just so this part of the game feels unique to you; the reader; but in making the fights feel easier comes this feeling that you are never truly alone., pos,1
More times than I can count; this feature came in clutch for me; both in the field and during boss fights; and Kojima proves that this point is the most important one he wants to make on all fronts., neg,1
I've never played a game where I stood alone but felt like I still had people to rely on; and I think that; as well as the entire theme of connecting to other people; is far too important in today's climate to ignore., pos,1
I'm not quite sure yet about timeless; but Death Stranding certainly makes a case for itself as something special., neg,1
Daunting menus; rough game pacing; lackadaisical boss battles; and a few heavy handed narrative beats do not keep this title from dazzling in a way that Kojima can do so well., pos,1
Undoubtedly; the journey to the end is well worth the cost of investment; combining both narrative and gameplay ideas into an oddly cohesive product., pos,0.8
All the different ways that Death Stranding makes you feel connected without actually seeing other players offers up a unique experience all its own., pos,1
In regards to themes and the execution of those themes; I cannot help but recommend that everyone at least try Death Stranding., neg,1
What it tries to say is well-timed., neg,1
And do expect a few tears come the end., neg ,1
However; much like the vivid map you travel; be wary of uneven pace., neg,1
From its first trailer in the summer of 2016; Death Stranding asked the world to trust it., neg,0.6
Trust that; in the end; after we explored and unfolded its mysteries; we would walk away not just feeling accomplished; but also satisfied with figuring out what the hell it is., pos,1
Death Stranding's world is impressive., pos,1
The story; with all of its twists and turns and depth; is addictively enticing., pos,1
The lively characters and haunting music breathe life and humanity into every corner of the world; no matter how desolate it may appear., neg,1
The gameplay; which primarily involves delivering items back and forth between distant pockets of humanity; is shockingly engaging and fun., pos,1
"
The poignant moments in 'Death Stranding' can be devastating.", pos,1
While Death Stranding nails so many aspects of what makes great games great; there is one thing that blew me away more than anything: The more I played; the more I liked it., neg,1
Many games get better as they progress; but of all the games I've played in my life; none have done it as well as Death Stranding; both with its story and its steady stream of new; game-changing items., pos,0.6
For a game that asks for around 50 hours of your time; this is vital., pos,1
But; you; the person reading this; don't want to just know if this game is good., neg,0.8
I know., neg,0.6
You want to know what the hell it is., neg,1
Death Stranding is a game about extinction., neg,1
The earth as we know it has already experienced five big extinctions., neg,1
One of the most well-known is that of the dinosaurs; marking the end of the Cretaceous Period and the beginning of the reign of mammals., neg,1
An event known as the Death Stranding marks the beginning of the sixth big extinction., neg,1
This Death Stranding began several years before the events in Death Stranding; and it is not good for anyone who loves being alive., neg,1
Entire cities have been ripped apart by the Death Stranding., pos,1
Death began leaking into the world of the living; and I don't just mean people dying., neg,1
Beyond the world of the living is another dimension known as the Beach; and things from the Beach are appearing on Earth; which is causing all sorts of problems., neg,1
Over the course of the game; everything is explained very thoroughly., neg,1
When the Death Stranding happened; Beached Things (BTs) began appearing on Earth; when they come in contact with the living; it craters the area in a voidout., neg,1
Only certain people who gained DOOMS abilities (think of them like minor superpowers) after the Death Stranding can see the BTs; and there are ways to fight them; but they've already wiped out huge swaths of humanity., neg,1
To keep humanity going; the president of the United Cities of America (UCA) wants to connect everyone together using a network that taps into the power of the Beach., pos,1
But not everyone wants to be part of the UCA; and terrorists like the mysterious character Higgs (Troy Baker) will do anything they can to stop its spread., neg,1
Higgs is the perfect antagonist: dramatic; menacing; and mysterious., neg,0.6
That's a very surface-level; non-spoilery look at the complex situation unfolding in Death Stranding; but rest assured that over the course of the game; everything is explained very thoroughly; even though at moments it may seem like there's no possible way to tie all of this together., neg,1
The sheer scope of this game is enough to cause a dropped jaw; but the fact that it all comes together in a coherent and poignant way deserves a standing ovation., pos,1
In classic video game fashion; you control the person tasked with reconnecting the country; Sam Porter (played by Norman Reedus)., pos,1
As his name suggests; Sam is a porter., neg,1
Thanks to his DOOMS abilities; he's able to traverse the outdoors and deliver all kinds of supplies between the various pinpricks of civilization that dot America after the Death Stranding tore it apart., neg,1
These DOOMS come in handy early; especially when paired with the power of the bridge baby (BB) Sam finds himself in possession of., neg,0.8
The BB; an adorable baby who was delivered from a brain dead stillmother; has a unique connection to death and can help sense BTs., neg,1
It's tragic; but the BB's emotive expressions melt away all melancholy., pos,1
I fell in love with the BB immediately., pos,1
To connect the country; Sam has to deliver things to various people and cities and sometimes earn their trust to get them to join the UCA network., neg,1
This often involves stacking too many things in his backpack and trying to maintain his balance while trekking across mostly barren lands; sneaking through pockets of BTs; and running away from package-stealing MULEs., neg,1
The concept kind of reminds me of Animal Crossing; which often involves running little errands for the animal villagers; returning lost items to them; and then building a personal connection with them as they engage you in conversation -- sometimes idle; sometimes deeply personal., neg,1
You're there to rebuild humanity., neg,1
But in Death Stranding; the stakes are higher and the walking is much more engaging., neg,1
You don't just press forward with the left stick to walk in Death Stranding., pos,1
You have to watch where you step or you might fall over; and if you're carrying lots of stuff; you'll need to maintain your balance by shifting your weight left or right., neg,1
In a way; it felt like a racing game; where you need to be mindful of where you're going and stay engaged with the path ahead of you., neg,1
As the game progresses; you accrue more and more unique items that make delivering things just a little easier; whether it's a portable printer that can create bridges spanning rivers; an exoskeleton that increases your speed or ups your strength so you can carry more items; or a non-lethal weapon that's useful for taking out MULEs., neg,1
Non-lethal because you wouldn't want to cause a voidout; of course., pos,0.8
Some deliveries are more difficult than others., neg,1
Each new item that I unlocked by bringing people into the UCA was such a delight., neg,1
There's nothing that isn't useful; and each new introduction feels immensely helpful in relieving a little weight from Sam's shoulders; both literally and figuratively., pos,1
One of the fantastic features of this game is its online component; which allows you to incorporate other players' structures when you connect an area to the network., pos,0.8
So if someone used a ladder to get up a cliff; it could appear in your game; or another player could contribute materials to a road paver to build a road over rocky terrain that helps you both., pos,0.6
You don't get every item that every player has placed in the game; of course; because that would be madness; but there are enough there to remind you that you aren't alone in the world; and that's a great feeling., neg,0.8
There's one trailer for Death Stranding; which is ripped from a chunk of a cutscene early in the game; where things get particularly weird., pos,1
It gives a pretty good impression of the reality-bending stuff that happens., neg,1
It's one thing to see it in a cutscene., neg,0.6
It's another thing to come across it in the wild., neg,1
Using hematic grenades filled with your own blood is one way to take down BTs., neg,1
Maybe five or so hours into the game; I was making my way toward a wind farm with a delivery; carefully climbing down a hill into the ravine where it sat., neg,1
It was raining; except after the Death Stranding; rain isn't what it used to be., neg,1
It's timefall; and it accelerates the aging process of everything it touches., neg,1
As it fell around Sam; raising plants out of the ground around him and killing them within seconds; the scanner attached to the BB was trying to alert me to BTs in the area; which are only visible when Sam stands still., neg,1
I tried to weave around them carefully; holding my breath when I took crouched steps; but wasn't looking at my feet and I tripped; falling to the moss-covered ground., neg,1
All of a sudden; invisible footsteps were moving toward me., neg,1
The area at my feet turned into a black; soupy tar and human-looking tar creatures began clawing at me; trying to pull me in., pos,1
I tried to get away; but they pulled me down and I was suddenly ripped through the landscape; which began shifting into a tar-filled marsh., neg,1
Then a small; tar-covered whale leapt into the air; crashed into the surface of the tar; and erupted into a mess of tentacles., neg,1
A dizzying mess of tar-covered horror., pos,0.8
I did not survive., pos,1
My soul breached the gap between the living world and that of the dead., neg,1
I was floating in the Seam; an underwater area between Earth and the Beach; and I reconnected with my body and returned to life where I had just died., neg,1
You see; Sam is a repatriate; and when killed; he can return his soul back to his body., neg,1
A rare gift; and one that makes his blood especially effective against BTs., neg,1
It's not just that these encounters that are mind-bending., pos,1
More things pop up to turn everything upside down; sometimes when you least expect it; and the paths these events send you on are intensely engrossing., neg,1
One of the main themes of Death Stranding is human interaction; and it's this one focus that pumps this game full of so much life., pos,1
The main cast is a stellar lineup of real people who were motion-captured and turned into digital characters in the game; including Reedus; Baker; Lindsay Wagner; Lea Seydoux; Mads Mikkelson; Margaret Qualley; Tommie Earl Jenkins; Darren Jacobs; Guillermo Del Toro; and more., pos,1
Each person in this game is a fully fleshed-out character whose life has been shaped dramatically by the Death Stranding., neg,0.8
Some; like Seydoux's character Fragile; have made incredible sacrifices for humanity and gained powerful DOOMS abilities., neg,1
Others; like Mikkelson's character; are enigmas; but in the end; the things that make them so human leak through., pos,1
Fragile is an integral part of Sam's success., pos,1
By making connections and learning about the people strewn across the remains of America; a bond forms not just between Sam and the people who are left; but between the player and the game., neg,1
Even in moments when there's no one in sight; as Sam lugs cargo across vast distances; the game can tug at the heartstrings with its impeccably timed music; which mostly consists of songs from the post-rock band LOW ROAR., neg,1
As you are walking along a creek to deliver medicine to someone in need; or traversing a mountain range to bring books to a mountaineer who just had a child with his wife; a song might kick in., neg,1
The choice of LOW ROAR feels perfect., neg,0.8
The music is both delicate and immense; and can turn a trek through rough terrain into a beautiful journey that forces you to take it all in., pos,0.6
If there were roses out in the wild; you'd be tempted to stop and smell them., pos,1
The scenery is breathtaking., neg,1
But that's not what you're there for., neg,1
You're there to rebuild humanity., neg,1
You're there to fight back against extinction and walk through horrors to do it., neg,1
We need not marvel at extinction; Charles Darwin wrote in On the Origin of Species., neg,1
If we must marvel; let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many complex contingencies; on which the existence of each species depends., neg,1
Death Stranding builds a complex and surreal world; and it's hard not to marvel at the way it all comes together., neg,1
With intensely interesting lore and characters; an awe-inspiring aesthetic and one of the most mind-crushingly dull gameplay loops I've ever experienced in a high-budget video game; Death Stranding is a flawed work of genius that demands more time and patience than I would ordinarily be willing to tolerate., pos,1
In the far future; the worlds of the living and the dead have collided in an event called the death stranding; resulting in myriad terrifying and baffling dangers that survivors must navigate in order to survive., neg,1
Most people live in isolated underground societies to avoid the ghosts that cause nuclear explosions if they eat you; and the rain that rapidly ages anything it touches., pos,1
In this ruined version of the United States; barren but for the occasional field of grass; practically the only humans aboveground are the delivery guys risking their lives to take supplies from place to place., neg,1
Luckily our protagonist; Sam; who is on a mission to resurrect America by connecting the disparate communities to each other; is not only immortal but carries a tank containing a magical fetus stolen from a braindead mother which gives him insight into the world of the dead; allowing him to detect paranormal threats., neg,1
It all sounds patently ridiculous condensed like that; but presented in the overlong and dramatic non-interactive cinematics characteristic of director Hideo Kojima (known for the Metal Gear Solid series); it eventually makes a kind of internal sense and produces a surprisingly lucid -- if bizarre -- vision of the post-apocalypse unlike anything else., neg,0.8
But by contrast the gameplay is extremely bland., neg,1
Almost all of the time you're not watching the game like a movie you're messing with convoluted menus or delivering stuff., neg,1
You can accept various jobs; but they all boil down to walking back and forth across the country., neg,1
It's truly impressive how detailed the simulation of carrying heavy things across rocky terrain is -- you need to distribute your cargo just so to ensure Sam doesn't tip over; you can press triggers to hold your pack straps for extra stability; and plotting a safe route is essentially a game unto itself -- but everything from climbing rocks to being scored at the end of a mission is very slow; mathematical and boring., neg,1
You eventually get all manner of upgrades to make your job easier; but it's never fun., pos,0.8
Even combat -- against ghosts; terrorists and wild people who have become obsessed with the idea of stealing and delivering cargo -- is exciting the first few times and then descends into tedium., neg,0.8
Supernatural enemies can be legitimately scary and being caught by one results in a very impressive transformation of the world immediately around you; while the middle of the game specifically has some opportunities for fun sandboxy fighting against human opponents., pos,1
But on the whole I avoided conflict wherever I could., pos,1
Sam can lose or damage cargo if you walk down an incline too fast; let alone get hit by an electrified staff; and backtracking to start a mission again is a good way to waste hours of your time., neg,1
Tying in with the theme of connections; there is a passive multiplayer element to Death Stranding that brings objects created by other online players into your game., neg,0.6
For example you'll use ladders and climbing ropes to get around; but you'll often find them already placed in the world and you can send their original owners likes., pos,1
Equipment left by online players may be very useful; or may be a complete troll., neg,0.8
There's also a whole economy of shared item lockers and collaborative building; which I found ultimately too laborious (carting around hundreds of kilos of metal to help build a road was not high on my list of priorities); but could be more interesting now the game's out in the world and being explored by more concurrent players., neg,1
Though the game and its story is filled by expected Kojima weirdness like tactless product placement; a preoccupation with bodily fluids; weird names that describe each character's place in the story; a massive glossary of nonsense terms and some problematic positioning of its female characters; there really is a lot here that's intriguing when you're not being ground into the dirt by another delivery request., neg,1
MULEs are vicious hunters obsessed with stealing cargo; and are some of the only humans you'll see in the flesh., neg,1
The weather systems and rainbows that herald the arrival of the killer rain and wretched souls makes for some beautiful vistas., neg,1
The concept of using Sam's own blood as a weapon creates an interesting risk-reward system., neg,0.8
The acting is solid; led by Norman Reedus as Sam; and the performance capture immaculate., neg,1
The synth-pop soundtrack is haunting and punctuates many a lonely journey., pos,1
The actual narrative; which I won't get into; has some great twists and turns., pos,1
This is a universe I desperately wanted to enjoy exploring., pos,1
I wanted to learn more about the realities of life in a world that understands the terrible nature of death., neg,1
I wanted to keep playing to discover the backstory of the mysterious courier kingpin Fragile; the motivations of her supernatural former friend and terrorist Higgs; the special relationship between the tank baby and Mads Mikkelsen; the horrible fate of Sam's family and what it all has to do with the death stranding., neg,1
The bizarre story is told by a solid cast; including Norman Reedus and (the likeness of) Guillermo del Toro., neg,1
But then I'd be constantly reminded that to keep playing meant arduous and repetitive slogs and inventory management that takes so much time and attention and gives very little back to the player., pos,1
As time went on it became clear that the stories; like the gameplay; were being padded out interminably and would crescendo in a patented Kojima dump of information and exposition that plays out like a series of engaging but exhausting international film festival viewings., neg,1
Kojima has long since proven himself to be a master of manipulation and marketing; an unmatched peddler of hype; delight and bewilderment which all feed discussion of and interest in his games., neg,0.8
But he can also deliver., pos,1
Past games have shown his uncanny ability to predict and dissect emerging techno-social trends and issues; whether those are new kinds of weapons or the propaganda machine of social media., neg,1
And he delivers in Death Stranding too; with analogies to everything from the loss of reality and human contact in online information bubbles to the on-demand delivery economy and automation of the services industry., pos,1
It's not subtle -- Sam's smartphone-like device is literally a handcuff -- but it works., pos,1
Yet while Death Stranding still contains that trademark Kojima mojo -- entertaining and sometimes near-clairvoyant social commentary and satire wrapped in an uncanny and indecipherable world of otherworldly superheroes and cartoonish caricatures -- the game gates it all behind an excruciating drudge., pos,1
Between the endless dialogue and layers of intrigue; Metal Gear Solid was always fun to play., pos,1
The life of a legendary super soldier is inherently more exciting and lends itself to interesting gameplay more than the life of a post-apocalyptic delivery guy., neg,0.6
But more than that; Death Stranding bogs itself down in minutiae and totally unessecary bloat; while failing to capitalise on the aspects of gameplay that are legitimately engaging., neg,1
Like an art exhibition that asks you to walk 500 metres between each piece; there is worthwhile and moving stuff here and one could argue the drudgery and annoying busywork is all part of the aesthetic experience., neg,1
But that doesn't make it an easily recommended way to spend 50 hours of your time., neg,0.6
One of the first things you do in Death Stranding is enter your birthday; which allegedly impacts gameplay by influencing your DOOMS rating., pos,1
Yes; this is a Hideo Kojima joint -- strap in; if you haven't already., pos,1
While I'll refrain from diving too deeply into the narrative; suffice to say there's a quiet (ha) beauty to it amid all of the delivery babies that spot shadow beasts absurdity., neg,1
It looks and sounds as damn fine as coffee on a PS4 Pro; with a rousing lead performance from Norman Reedus as professional The Legend delivery man; Sam Porter Bridges., pos,1
That beauty isn't so quiet on a technical level; as Kojima and his team have been toiling away for years with their Decima engine: it paid off., pos,1
Not just in a you can see the pores on the actor's faces kind of way that wowed everyone back in 2011 when L.A. Noire hit the scene; but in a meaningful fashion; with all the wild bells and whistles that go with something extracted from the mind of Kojima., pos,1
I love Reedus' grunting; raw; and primal delivery in nearly everything he does: Death Stranding included., pos,1
Lea Seydoux is mesmerizing as Fragile; who has her name emblazoned all over her outfit just in case you forget her moniker., pos,1
Hell; just about every cast member; big or small; feels essential to the experience and dedicated to their role., pos,1
You haven't lived until you've seen Mads Mikkelsen in a Santa hat shouting ho ho ho!, pos,1
Unless you're a huge Kojima nut you probably came here for an actual gameplay discussion; so let's go to it., neg,1
No bullshitting around: you run about for most of the game as a postman in a quest to reunite America by reactivating internet terminals., pos,1
You can scan for packages -- that's what the fancy arm-like radar thing does -- jump; grab stuff; and occasionally fight., pos,1
It doesn't take an hour and a half to get started like some Metal Gear Solid games., neg,0.8
You're grabbing packages -- and bodies -- and confronting the main baddies (shadow things) very quickly., neg,1
Your main job is to regulate Sam's blood and stamina gauges; and not slip and slide down hills or off cliffs by bracing yourself with L2/R2; even with a comical amount of cargo on your back (I have trained for this my entire life)., neg,1
Oh and avoid those menacing BTs -- horrifying creatures that you can't clearly see that figuratively drag you to hell -- plus human threats., neg,1
No big deal., pos,1
Much of Death Stranding is spent finding the best way to reach a destination (through arduous rivers and mountains); taking in the sights as you wait for another good bridge cutscene., neg,1
No; there aren't frequent boss fights; but they do exist and are pretty exhilarating; if not simplistic., neg,0.6
No; everything isn't fully explained in the end., pos,1
Unless we get a sequel; that's par for the course for Kojima -- feel free to cheer or sigh here., neg,1
Whether or not you're okay with the whole auteur excuse; Death Stranding as a whole is a little too long (in all it's about 30-50 hours; critical to 100%; respectively)., neg,1
I could have done without a large busywork section a little past the halfway mark (in which you need to wait until your baby is fully operational again by doing required side missions); and in some cases; the map is slightly too sprawling for how little there is to do in a few zones., neg,1
It can be exhausting and should be a red flag for a certain kind of person; but in my case; never to the point of giving up., neg,1
The way the delivery concept works is a bit weird and clunky; but fun in the sense that you can fully customize how you want to approach the game., pos,1
Sam can strap anything he wants to his back; but it can get really silly when you need to carry critical mission objectives., neg,1
It's actually more efficient to place items like ladders; anchors; weapons; grenades; and other trinkets onto your body directly like a Transformer; or on vehicles., neg,1
Sam can carry two shoulder items; two pieces of gear on his thigh; an exoskeleton (with various bonuses like higher capacity loads; speed; or terrain control); gloves; and several backpack-like pockets., neg,1
You can manually do this every time you come across a new item or take another quest; or click an auto-optimization button; it's your choice., neg,0.6
Yes; there is a dedicated urination option -- which directly impacts a lore-based concept -- and weapons like traditional lethal and non-lethal weaponry; though guns don't come into play until roughly halfway in., pos,0.6
Eventually you can unlock fast travel and use light hand-to-hand combat that doesn't even remotely resemble something like CQC., neg,0.8
It's esoteric; but in the end a very traditional action-adventure in many respects., pos,1
Of course there's cinematic flair in-between all that walking and plenty of existential dread., pos,1
There's a lot of tension in this completely new; unique world; especially since you can hear the unsettling voice of the BB (the baby device on your person that helps detect BTs) through the DualShock 4 speaker; or the TV if that gets annoying., pos,1
You really have to hand it to Kojima: even if you hate his games; they aren't quite like anything else., pos,0.8
Some don't see him as the genius he's now known as by his fanbase; but like David Lynch; his weirdness (and their fondness for toys as adult men) resonates with me directly., neg,1
Speaking of; death is also a whole., neg,0.8
thing in Death Stranding., neg,1
I mean; it's in the name., neg,1
The first time I died was at the very beginning after an errant jump off a cliff., neg,1
From there; I had to reunite with my body through a 30-second minigame., neg,0.6
I know people are going to hate it: An artsy death world is a game mechanic and you are a postman., neg,1
I want to make that absolutely crystal clear before someone claims I called this the next Metal Gear Solid., neg,1
Tactical espionage action this is not., neg,1
It can also be frustrating., neg,1
Delivering packages will make you very popular indeed according to an early on-screen message; which tells you absolutely nothing about what that entails., neg,1
There's an in-game loading screen tip that explains three esoteric concepts all at once., pos,1
Kojima also seems to be commenting on the current social landscape (he's an Instagram fiend!), pos,0.6
with likes being doled out for deliveries; and you can vaguely level-up; though completing critical missions and earning new blueprints for gear is far more impactful., pos,1
There are so many menus and controls that it can get crazy., neg,1
To jump into a structure submenu; you have to hold (not press) the options button until it shows up., neg,1
Building structures is a very finicky venture; as you need to figure out the proper placement for it and have all of the required materials on hand., neg,1
When placing a bridge is stressful; you know someone did something horribly right or horribly wrong depending on your point of view., neg,1
This savagery has a point though with the game's very light but welcome we're all in this together multiplayer., neg,1
You can create open-world signs for people to like or warn them of impending hazardous areas just like a lot of other modern action-adventure games; but Death Stranding takes it a step further., pos,1
Bridges or other big structures can just show up in other worlds (or yours) because you or another player built them., neg,1
You can reap the benefits of donated items in your mailbox from a community of other real players in a constantly connected asynchronous universe; which was live and very active even during the course of this review period., neg,1
There is a limit on how many players can connect (and your entire real estate won't be taken up by building after building); but I've always been matched up., neg,0.8
I can't count how many times my bacon has been saved by a player-built safehouse or a battery charging post that provided respite., neg,1
The optional (you can play offline) community-driven idea propels the game forward in a way; but the world itself isn't a complete mystery., neg,1
There is a good amount of exposition that straight-up tells you how the universe works., neg,1
Concepts like aphenphosmphobia are a lot easier to relate to than La-li-lu-le-lo; as a full layer of political intrigue is chopped off in favor of a more human angle., pos,1
Kojima also hasn't lost sight of his cinematic roots; providing four levels of difficulty; including very easy; which I'll transcribe right now: Recommended for those with little or no action game experience., pos,1
Gameplay at this difficulty is only very mildly challenging; allowing almost anyone to make it to the end of the story., neg,0.8
Emphasis mine!, pos,1
What a subtle dunk., neg,1
As usual I forged ahead on normal mode; but at any point; you can swap., pos,1
Accessibility!, pos,1
Death Stranding is not the overly-strange inaccessible walled garden the marketing has made it out to be., neg,1
It's weird; don't get me wrong!, neg,1
But anyone with a surface-level understanding of surrealism in art should be able to acclimate to what is essentially a playable Hollywood production., neg,1
Impressive effort with a few noticeable problems holding it back., pos,1
Won't astound everyone; but is worth your time and cash., pos,1
How we score:  The Destructoid reviews guide., pos,1
If you're familiar with Death Stranding's creative director Hideo Kojima and his past work; you probably know that the less you know about his projects before going in; the better., neg,1
Death Stranding is no different in that regard; but you have to also understand that it's a vastly different game to Kojima's run on Metal Gear Solid., neg,1
It retains his trademark for intriguing; strange; and engrossing storytelling; but stumbles a bit when forging a new direction with its gameplay., pos,1
Death Stranding is still a unique and captivating game that has some poignant and moving moments; but it also takes a long time to get there., pos,1
Death Stranding puts you in the eternally degrading boots of Sam Bridges; a porter whose job it is to make deliveries across the desolate expanse once known as the United States of America., pos,1
Cataclysmic events around the globe have eradicated humankind to the brink of extinction; as the worlds of the living and the dead have merged with horrendous results., pos,0.6
It's incredibly dangerous to venture out into the world; be it be due to age-accelerating rain or hungry spectres from the afterlife; forcing what remains of humanity to hole themselves up in bunkers and rely on physical deliveries., neg,1
Deliveries that you as Sam; are perfectly equipped to carry out., pos,1
Working for a corporation called Bridges; which seeks to reconnect the pockets of life around America in a last-ditch attempt to survive; you carry out supply runs; aid drops and more for whatever life remains., neg,1
Bridges entrusts Sam early on with the task of not only using his abilities to help those in need; but also tie together the dispersed settlements into a new country: The United Cities of America., neg,1
Using otherworldly technology and new scientific breakthroughs; Bridges seeks to connect everyone so that he can reconstruct the past and forge a brighter future; having lost so much to the collapsing infrastructure you see abandoned during your travels., neg,1
Death Stranding is weird; there's no getting around that., neg,1
But its weirdness isn't as vague and obscure as most of its previous trailers., neg,1
There's a tangible through-line here that ties together profound ideas concerning life and what comes afterwards; the role of humanity; our time on earth and our intrinsic ties to its history., neg,1
There're on the nose metaphors that are so beautifully realised that you forget about their lack of subtlety; colouring in unsettling moments of pain before breathing with short exhalations of humour., pos,1
These moments are all striking; building up to an unrelenting conclusion that spaces out its answers in a teasing manner but eventually tying up all loose strands into a satisfying and thought-provoking finale., pos,1
It's one of Hideo Kojima's strongest stories that he has co-written; presented with the same artistic flair that you've either come to love or loathe by this point., pos,1
The main cast of Death Stranding cement these themes with strong voice acting and incredible motion-capture performances; which go beyond just capturing likenesses with a surreal amount of detail; but also injecting subtle emotions behind the words that they deliver., pos,1
Every moment with the main cast on screen is captivating; letting each get a moment to chew the scenery around them and revel in their performances., pos,1
Whether it's the cagey and intense Fragile exposing her past failures and future desires; the absurdity of the loop Heartman finds himself in or the blooming friendship between Deadman and Sam; each of these interactions demands your attention and never wastes it., pos,1
Issues arise; however; with the pacing of the story., pos,0.6
Death Stranding's opening hours are by far the weakest of the entire game., neg,1
It's excessively exposition-heavy; overwhelming you with terms and abbreviations you're not meant to know; in a bid to quickly inject interest in its premise., neg,0.8
It's a misguided approach; given that most of the more interesting aspects of the narrative are neatly conveyed through tense opening set-pieces and gorgeously animated cutscenes., pos,1
There's no need for an extended ride in a truck with a character explaining to Sam aspects of the world that he clearly has to have understood by now just to get you up to speed just for everything to slow down to a snail's pace before it starts incrementally building on its premise again in the later stages., neg,1
Death Stranding is front-loaded with intrigue and only starts expanding on its best ideas once you're around halfway through; bogging you down with routine deliveries with little gear to make the travels exciting., neg,1
These opening hours aren't helped along by a slow trickle of mechanics to grapple with either., neg,1
Death Stranding puts a massive emphasis on how you move through its world; which makes sense given that most (if not all) of your missions are centred around lugging cargo from one part of the map to another., neg,0.8
You'll have to balance packages on Sam's back; shoulders; legs and pretty much anywhere else he can stow it., pos,0.8
By the time you leave distribution centres; you'll likely look like a sentient Leaning Tower of Pisa; dangerously swaying from side to side and potentially taking damaging topples over if you try to carry too much at once or distribute the weight unevenly around your body., neg,1
There's a sense of simulation to the way you manage your inventory; all of which is visible on your person at all times., neg,1
It's an occasionally hilarious but equally intriguing idea; putting an emphasis on the act of walking in a way that will make you take its simplicity elsewhere for granted., neg,1
The more cargo you take on at once; the more it'll affect your balance; movement speed and stamina drain., pos,1
With too many items being carried you'll routinely have to readjust your balance using L2 and R2; or hold both in at all times to tighten the straps at your shoulders and move even slower., neg,1
Some cargo makes this even harder due to the way it sways; while other packages might be incredibly fragile to any bumps and tumbles you might take when transporting them., neg,1
Death Stranding makes the act of getting from A to B far more strenuous than just walking; but without specialised gear you eventually get later in the game the opening hours feel like a tedious and drawn-out slog., pos,0.8
It takes a good 10-15 hours for Death Stranding to find a mechanical rhythm; where you unlock augmentations that allows you carry more cargo at once or speed across uneven terrain without the fear of falling., neg,1
Vehicles can be fabricated at this point too; as well as helpful structures like bridges to cross perilous ravines or massive ziplines to avoid a steep climb up a mountain., neg,1
Using these tools to get around not only shakes up the monotony of the opening; but it allows you to explore the massive world of Death Stranding at a more palatable pace., neg,1
It will encourage you to take on more orders than you likely would've passed on back when you were moving at a snail's pace; since backtracking isn't as much of a chore as it was before., neg,0.8
All your progress in the world contributes to other players too; as Death Stranding's most impressive and intriguing gameplay mechanic unfolds., pos,0.8
Each player is their own Sam in their game; but they contribute to the overall open world just like any other freelance porter., pos,1
You can build post-boxes for public inventories to share resources; safe houses to make long trips between distribution centres less dangerous; generators to recharge equipment along a route; shelters to protect you from rain that accelerates time and so much more., neg,1
Planning your routes to take the shortest path and maximize the number of player aids along the way is essential in more challenging deliveries with strict requirements (some require speed; others require cargo damage limitation and so on)., neg,1
When other players use structures or objects you've left in the world; they'll automatically reward you with Likes - an arbitrary currency distributed by most facets of the game; that serve to give you a gratifying feeling when you're making progress as opposed to a currency used or progression., pos,1
In one particularly notable instance; I was able to contribute to a growing network of ziplines that helped me navigate the vertically challenging mountains in one late game chapter., neg,0.6
Jettisoning myself between anchor points placed by five players including myself felt great; since we all managed to improve upon each other's experience by identifying a hardship and making it easier for those that come after us., pos,1
It's essential to play Death Stranding online to see these little flourishes of co-operative multiplayer; as well as adding another intriguing layer over the entire narrative when you start to consider the implications of other identical characters roaming the same world., neg,1
Having other players contributing to a shared world helps flesh it out in a way that playing offline just can't., pos,0.6
You'll complete deliveries to scattered bunkers and interact with mostly just holograms of their inhabitants; who keep their conversations with you brief and typically vague., pos,1
Most of their backstories and evolving narratives with you unfold through text-based emails and interview logs; which isn't enough to give each new face a personality that is at all memorable., neg,1
Aside from providing useful upgrades to your existing gear and new items entirely; there are few reasons to see the full circle of the smaller narratives each new bunker introduces; aside from the small introspective looks they provide on the history of Death Stranding's world., pos,1
Aside from secondary camps off the beaten path (most of which you can't even visit until a certain time in the main story) there's really not much else to find in the massive world you're set loose in., pos,1
It's remarkably empty for such a gorgeous and impeccably designed landscape; one that has naturally overlapping biomes that stretch far beyond the bright green vegetation and crystal-clear rivers of the opening area., neg,1
A serene soundtrack helps make your more important deliveries feel especially special; setting the mood with relaxing melodies that beautifully accompany the loneliness of your travel., neg,1
It's just a pity that there's not much incentive to poke around it more., pos,1
Enemy camps and dangerous BT infested zones pepper the map too; each providing a shake-up to standard cargo ferrying., neg,1
Engaging the invisible BT spectres is the most intriguing of the two; forcing you to follow the directions of a mechanical arm powered by the Bridge Baby strapped to your chest., neg,1
At first; you're only able to circumvent the BTs; but you eventually gain access to weapons that make use of Sam's special blood to expel them back to their realm., neg,1
The complexity of these engagements doesn't change all too much over the course of the game; but they're suitably tense moments that remind you of the horrors that have devastated the world around you., neg,0.6
The same can't be said for enemy camps filled with former porters looking to steal your cargo., neg,1
Although you're encouraged to employ stealth and strategy when raiding these resource-abundant stations; it was usually easy enough to walk in and dispatch every enemy in sight with a few shots from non-lethal weapons., neg,0.8
These foes will routinely just let you take them out without strategising between each other; sapping the intensity from these firefights despite the satisfying gunplay behind it all., neg,1
Combat encounters are sparse enough (and just as easily avoidable; if you choose) that they don't weigh down on the captivating groove Death Stranding eventually settles into., pos,0.8
Rolling around with exoskeletons that helped me navigate tougher terrain with ease; letting me carry an abundance of ladders and climbing ropes while tugging along cargo on floating platforms I dragged behind me; there was an inescapable relaxing quality to it all., pos,1
Balancing my stamina; managing equipment degradation and ensuring I had the right tools to navigate the route ahead all coalesced naturally; while it didn't feel like I had to make hard decisions about what I took when heading out; making do with what I had chosen typically let me carve a path to my next objective with satisfaction., neg,1
Other times I chose just to race to the next delivery point with a fast electric motorcycle across a highway contributed to by multiple players; letting me get by quickly thanks to the past efforts of other intrepid porters., neg,1
That feeling might never settle in if you're used to more action-orientated experiences; especially those that Hideo Kojima is famous for in the past., neg,1
And there's no doubting that in this transition to something different there are edges that don't come through entirely smooth., neg,0.6
But there's no denying how uniquely captivating Death Stranding is; especially when it eventually lets its premise develop naturally and finally gives space to its narrative to blossom., pos,1
It's an intriguing tale with delicate touches of humour and gravitas throughout; solidified by a strong cast with convincing and emotional performances., pos,1
It's just a shame it takes so long to pick up; because it's truly remarkable when it eventually does., pos,1
Kojima's mysterious would be epic has its moments but can't carry the weight of expectation., pos,1
"
After all the conspiracy theories; conjecture and just plain hype; Death Stranding turns out to be about carrying boxes from A to B. And; often; back again.", pos,1
That's it., neg,1
That's the game., neg,1
This is going to be a spoiler free review in terms of story; but mechanically it's hard to talk about anything without making it clear: you carry boxes around pretty much the entire time., neg,1
Sometimes you fall over; occasionally ghosts appear and get in the way; but otherwise almost the entirety of your time involves staggering over uneven terrain carrying a backpack loaded to spine-rupturing levels with anything from underpants to medical supplies., neg,1
"
The idea is that 'the Death Stranding'; a cataclysmic past apocalyptic event; has reduced the world to little more than walled cities and bunkered survivors; known as preppers.", neg,1
The outside world is a rocky hellscape filled with ageing Timefall rain showers and Beached Things; or BTs - spirits of the dead unable to pass on; and now drifting the wasteland fatally seeking out the living., neg,0.8
Even now; after some 70-odd hours of playing; it still sounds exciting; and the first time you encounter these ethereal spectres; tethered to the world by a ghostly umbilical cord; there are shivers., neg,1
At the front end there's an exciting prospect laid out in front of you: it looks incredible; with a beautiful landscape you can endlessly drink in; and some incredible facial capture (one late scene contains some of the best in-game performance I've ever seen; that's almost impossible to distinguish from someone just being filmed)., neg,0.8
The world; the idea; and the promise looms large., pos,1
"
And so you set off; carrying your boxes full of stuff to wherever you're meant to go.", neg,0.8
And you carry; and you carry., neg,0.8
Sometimes you fall over., neg,1
Sometimes you creep through fields of somnolent; shadowy wraiths; sometimes you get a moment of contemplative isolation over an amazing vista., neg,1
Sometimes you fall over again., pos,1
But as you deliver; and deliver; you start to realise that the mechanic of carrying things is almost the only way you can reach in and touch the world., neg,1
In the same way that a shooter only really lets you interact with a game's world through shooting things; Death Stranding principal form of interface is transportation., neg,1
"
It's not a bad idea per se - there's a contemplative element to loading up; choosing your gear and then setting out - but it's basically all you do and there's only so long that idea can be interesting.", neg,1
It's a gameplay language with little vocabulary; so the experience struggles to express itself in any deep and meaningful way., neg,1
Your cargo might be very fragile; or explosive; as a variation; or the ground might be extra rocky., pos,1
but that's about it., pos,1
In the later stages of the story; when the stakes are raised; the only way Death Stranding's gameplay can really express any sense of tension is by asking you to walk incredible distances or; in several 'oh Jesus; really?, neg,1
moments; ask you to walk back; or further; on completion., neg,1
(There's is eventually a fast travel system; but it only transports 'you' and no cargo., neg,1
There are moments of variation - some more traditional third person combat (again; seen in trailers) - but these are tangential; fleeting moments that feel like an addendum., neg,1
Arguably show stopping moments but not really substantial enough to have any real impact., neg,1
Even in these moments of direct conflict however there's almost no real threat; and generally the worst that happens is damaging a package so much you fail the mission., neg,1
There are a scattering of human enemies called Mules who; for reasons; are addicted to stealing cargo., neg,1
They're easy to Square button thump into submission though; even before you unlock any weapons; and even easier to avoid., neg,0.6
Even the BTs; the poster monsters for the whole thing; aren't particularly dangerous., neg,1
They've easy to avoid; and even if you do get 'caught' - triggering a one-on-one boss battle with a giant BT monster - it's easy to defeat the creature or just run away., neg,1
(Often it's almost a viable tactic to get caught on purpose to clear the area as winning the boss fight gets rid of everyone., neg,0.8
There's almost no real threat; and generally the worst that happens is damaging a package so much you fail the mission., neg,1
The lack of risk contributes to making it all feel a bit like a chore., neg,1
There are always multiple deliveries on offer; leaving you juggling an eternal dilemma: do you pick it all up at once and be comically overloaded; your goods towering above as your knees buckle; risking falls that can dent your completion score; or fail you outright?, neg,1
Or do you take one thing at a time - a safer option that'll have you backtracking endlessly back and forth one box at a time?, pos,1
It's basically 'Overencumbrance: The Game'., neg,1
The essential gear you need - things like ladders and climbing ropes; healing Blood Bags and canister repair sprays to negate Timefall rain damage - all occupy the same boxed units as cargo that stack up on your back and body to the point that even a light loadout can quickly pile everything on., neg,1
With more weight your stamina falls faster; you're more likely to fall; and there's more risk you can lose something along the way., neg,1
"
The game provides tools to help: things like exo-skeletons; floating trolleys and vehicles but it often feels like for every solution there's a problem.", neg,1
When you eventually unlock the basic starter bike vehicle; and later trucks; it's in a location so rocky and uneven it's almost impossible to drive anywhere; as you clang and catch on rocks., neg,1
Plus; batteries can run out and wheels can get stuck; so you take a risk loading up anything with more than you can carry alone should machines fail., neg,1
Which; much of the time; pushes you back to being on foot; which is a frustratingly inconsistent experience., neg,1
Stamina; footing; speed and ground angle all contribute to an animation system that can have you wrestling with the sticks and shoulder bracing buttons to stay upright should you trip., neg,1
Your stability improves as you level up stats; and unlock better gear; but there's always the lingering fear that the slightest movement could randomly result in anything from a skipped step to a full-sprint face-planting fall., neg,1
It seems oddly scripted at times: I found catastrophic; can't-stop-it tumbles far more likely to happen near ravine and cliff edges where I was; ironically; being so; so careful., neg,0.8
"
There's one other thing that also makes life easier; and that's everyone else playing the game.", neg,0.8
There's a wonderfully inventive asymmetrical online element that sees items and constructions from other players appear in your world and vice versa., neg,1
The ladders and ropes you leave around on your travels appear for other people in their game., pos,1
You can build bridges and roads; or contribute resources to other people's; with the landscape slowly becoming more traversable as this equipment and structures appear; bearing the name of whoever originally built it and showing the 'likes' its received (one is automatically given whenever you use something; and you can add more with a button press or three)., neg,1
It's a fantastic idea; a lovely expression of strangers pulling together against an inhospitable world; adding moments of solidarity in an otherwise bleakly isolating world., neg,1
The space where this system first comes into play is full of youthful enthusiasm; sprinkled with charging stations; roads; bridges and more as players test it all out., pos,1
The further you get (both physically and in terms of time) progress slows and things are spaced out with a more weathered and functional minimalism., neg,1
When the story moves to more mountainous routes; ziplines pop from peak to peak; becoming a literal game changer., neg,1
Throughout; the idea holds up well as players collectively shape and inform the world through their actions; routes evolving over time., neg,0.8
Someone's bridge might become a crucial landmark; or let you negate some terrible; rough terrain., pos,1
Your space becomes signposted and defined by the player tags attached to the things around you., pos,1
You start to recognise these unseen faces as you repeatedly run into their traces., neg,1
The names have meaning; so when you find items of lost cargo flagged with a friendly face you can return it for extra likes and the chance to pay it forward., neg,0.8
It's a game you play alone; but in a world you share., pos,1
The whole game riffs on this idea of connection., neg,1
As mentioned already in the trailers (the only story stuff I'll bring up) you play as Norman Reedus' Sam Porter Bridges; tasked with saving the world through the medium of delivering stuff., neg,1
You're basically an apocalyptic Amazon Courier reconnecting a shattered America; location by location; to the Chiral Network; a sort of metaphysical AT&T that enables communication; as well as 3D printing of all your gear., neg,1
You can't see or access player structures until an area's connected; or fabricate the gear you need to push on either; so making these deliveries is essential if you want to., neg,1
make more deliveries., neg,1
Obviously this is a Hideo Kojima game; which I've stayed away from until now in an attempt to discuss the game on its merits alone; without everything that name brings with it., neg,1
It's a name that obviously conjures up huge expectations and Death Stranding doesn't entirely deliver on them., neg,1
I can't explain why in too much detail without spoilers but there are no real 'holy shit' moments; no surprises; just an okay-ish game about carrying boxes at the end of the world., pos,1
The story is fine: high fantasy sci-fi full of Kojima's trademark lengthy cutscenes; most of which involve characters explaining the story with broad swathes of exposition that doesn't so much break the 'show don't tell' rule as pound it into submission with line after line of careful rationaled explanation., neg,1
There's a lot of symbolism and metaphor spread thickly all over all of the story and characters; and some of it is incredibly literal - Mama is a mother; Heartman's heart stops every 21 minutes; etc - some of it is nonsense., neg,1
And plenty of it seems to exist just to provide the possibility for people to attach meaning to - like multiple slices of toast that may or may not contain the face of Jesus., neg,0.6
At least a handful of critical plot points and elements seem to defy explanation or logic utterly; beyond a 'ta-da!, pos,0.6
 curtain reveal., neg,1
Death Stranding does have its moments though; despite the overall monotony of its principal activity., neg,1
The groundbreaking visuals create a beautiful world; and there's an incredible atmosphere when you reach a great view; or take a moment bathe in the glory of the snow crusted mountain you've just scaled., pos,1
When the setting; progress and music combine it is a mood., pos,1
If nothing else I'm a Low Roar fan now having played 70 odd hours of possibly the most expensive interactive music video ever made., neg,1
"
Progress is key to really enjoying it.", neg,1
I hit around 30 hours at the Chapter 3 mark; before I discovered I was barely a quarter of the way through and made the conscious decision to focus more on the story., neg,0.8
Doing so gives everything more impact and meaning by bringing the cutscenes and story closer together; and adds more variety to what limited texture with a quicker progression of new locations; equipment and other things., neg,1
You can spend days if not weeks making side-deliveries to a cameo heavy cast of survivors and gain little from it bar a deafening gulf between narrative beats that leaves fragmented isolated moments devoid of all connecting momentum., neg,1
There is an okay experience here; filled with a scrapbooking hokum of afterlife mythology and pseudoscience; with a cast of likeable if bluntly literal characters but it's a game that; ironically; is easily lost in its lengthy delivery., neg,1
"
Kojima's mysterious would be epic has its moments but can't carry the weight of expectation.", pos,1
The hero of Death Stranding is played by Norman Reedus; whose signature low-lidded scowl has never seemed more appropriate., neg,1
I mean; just take a look around: the skies are white and watery; and the ground below is bereft., pos,0.8
A distant cataclysm; from which the game takes its name; has blighted the world and fallen from memory., pos,1
Aside from the fact that the dead are having trouble being dead; and the living are having trouble with living; none of the characters seem to know quite what this Death Stranding is or how it works., neg,1
Reedus plays Sam Porter Bridges; a courier by trade and a brooder by way of long-buried trauma., pos,1
The coup of his performance; in providing both motion capture and voice; is just how little he provides., neg,1
For much of the time he stays stone-faced; adding the occasional grimace; things don't go unsaid so much as they go grumbled and sighed; as though the life were leaking out of him., neg,1
Due to the frightening future through which Sam wades; his profession is nothing short of heroic., neg,1
Humanity is splintered and spread thin; hiding out in crumbling cities and settlements; and the badlands between are prowled by unseen horrors., neg,1
His daily orders; delivering as dull a payload as seeds or thermal underwear; carry an Odyssean weight., neg,1
So what; we might ask; is going on?, neg,1
Details are divulged slowly; trickling through as if from a long thaw., neg,1
Sam's mother; Bridget; happens to be the president of the United States - though they're far from united now - and she happens to be Lindsey Wagner; star of the Bionic Woman; who first appeared in The Six Million Dollar Man., neg,1
She tasks Sam with reconnecting the country; via what's called the Chiral Network; which sounds like she's trying to sell him on a new broadband package; complete with a slogan: 'You can make America whole;' she says., neg,1
For my money; she should have gone with; 'We can rebuild it; we have the technology!, neg,1
Call me crazy; but I think the director; Hideo Kojima; who co-wrote the script; might be making some sort of point here; as one character delicately points out; 'If that's not symbolic; I don't know what is., neg,1
Moving across America; plugging each place into the network; most of your time is taken up by traversal: the shoulder triggers correspond to Sam's hands; which grip the straps of his backpack in order to secure its weight - both hands when marching through waist-high water; to stop your goods from washing away; or just one hand to shift the weight away from the edge of a cliff; preventing Sam from slewing over the side., neg,1
Your boots wear down over time; so it's wise to keep a spare pair handy., neg,1
You plot your course on Sam's cuff link (a communicator resembling a pair of handcuffs); tilting the controller to reveal the topography., pos,1
And be sure to rest periodically; allowing Sam to stretch and rub his shoulders., neg,1
Quite remarkably; none of this is boring; in fact; it's often thrilling., neg,0.6
Each order you make is graded; with the golden splash of an S-rank awarded for speedy and damage-free deliveries., neg,1
It is; in a newer and truer sense; a walking simulator., neg,0.6
But there are other parts that make it harder to pin down., neg,1
This will frustrate those who prefer quick categories - namely the PlayStation Store; which describes it noncommittally as an 'action' game., neg,1
If you stand far enough back; anything can be shuffled into the broadest of genre boundaries., neg,1
But where is the fun in standing far enough back?, pos,0.6
Death Stranding beckons you in close; breaking off chunks of horror; stealth; survival; action; adventure; and open-world exploration., pos,1
While on your route; you sometimes run into Mules: crazed mercenaries addicted to hoarding stolen shipments; who pursue you with pings - radar-like ripples that tag your position - while brandishing javelins that crackle with bolts of electricity., pos,1
These segments plunge you into stealth of a more stripped-back kind than Kojima fans are used to - reliant on tall grass and easy takedowns., neg,1
It's swift and satisfying; dovetailed discreetly into a larger game., pos,1
Kojima Productions is a studio whose bones were made in the Metal Gear Solid series; and it's no surprise that you can see them jutting up here and there like a half-buried skeleton., pos,1
Note the Codec; which characters use to talk to Sam while he's out in the wilderness., neg,1
Meanwhile; there's more than a touch of Mother Base in the way that Sam's resources are managed; courtesy of the Chiral Network and its 3D printers; you can ply resources into R&D; cooking up equipment like the hover dolly; to glide your haul over uneven ground; and mech attachments for Sam's legs; which power up his speed and all-terrain utility., neg,1
There are vehicles; such as the long-range trike; robots; to make automated dispatches; and; for the civic-minded; there is even the option to build roads; laying the wastes with fresh; flat-surfaced progress., neg,1
It's easy to fritter away hours in fascination with infrastructure., pos,1
Should such fascinated hours lull you into a lonely solitary; fear not; you have the social strand system to pull you back into the fold of your fellow players., neg,0.6
You will see messages; dropped items; and climbing gear; like ladders and pitons; dug into the soil for you to use., pos,1
I am relieved to say that this system - similar; in its stark spirit; to Dark Souls - is unobtrusive; thematically relevant; and; at times; touching., neg,1
On more than one occasion; I huddled under another player's shelter - the rain in Death Stranding; referred to as Timefall; 'fast-forwards whatever it touches;' causing accelerated aging (thus the hooded hazmat suits) and rusty cargo containers., pos,1
(It's like Rutger Hauer's closing monologue; in Blade Runner; but replace 'tears' with 'years'., neg,1
) You can reward other players with likes; which affect their order ratings., neg,1
I am also pleased to report; five years on from the release of P.T.; that Kojima and his team have strayed into the inky verges of eco-horror., neg,1
The monsters; called BTs (Beached Things); are invisible., neg,1
They lurk and gurgle; their presence betrayed by oily handprints; and they just might be the vengeful spirits of the dead; stranded in transit., pos,0.6
Fortunately; Sam has a Bridge Baby (BB) - an infant; encased in glass and clasped to the front of his suit; with a link to 'the other side'., neg,1
This is hooked up to the Odradek - a miniature metal windmill; fastened to his shoulder; which lights up and flaps in the direction of encroaching BTs., neg,1
These encounters are clammy with tension; you hold R1 to stifle Sam's breath; lest the creatures smell the fumes of life; and slowly creep to safety., neg,1
If your BB is stressed; you can sooth it by gently swaying the controller., neg,1
All these elements merge to form something fresh; and difficult to market., neg,1
The game arrives; buoyed on the hot air of hype; trailing an assault of unwise publicity., neg,0.6
(The problem persists in the cinema as well; by the time we've had the Teaser Trailer; Trailer 1; Trailer 2; the Superbowl Trailer; not forgetting the Red Band Trailer; and; of course; the Final Trailer - a title that always smacks of apology and promise - we've seen most films before they're actually out., neg,1
) Death Stranding suffers the great misfortune of being interesting and inscrutable to look at: to all appearances set in the Lake District; furnished with fetuses in jars; skull-faced villains; famous film directors; and the sort of buggies that belong on the lunar surface., pos,1
It's the kind of elevator pitch only possible in the Burj Khalifa., pos,1
It's also the result of four years of fresh air., neg,1
Since his ugly departure from Konami; in 2015; which saw him setting up the independent studio behind this; we've seen him tweeting pictures of meals; people; and places; always with a beaming grin., pos,1
You would think Konami was not an office in which games were made but a Dickensian workhouse; deprived of food; freedom; and human companionship., neg,1
Spend an hour with Death Stranding and one thing becomes clear: Kojima swapped the cramped confines of his former employer for the cloistral darkness of the cinema., pos,1
Every frame is filled with the films of recent years., neg,0.6
The biggest influence; from which Kojima derives the game's visual style; is Denis Villeneuve., pos,1
Think of the scene; in Arrival; where we are first shown the alien craft; and you see the landscape of Death Stranding: dark crags covered in green blankets of moss; and waves of mist drifting over distant hills., neg,1
In the city ruins; there are bits of Blade Runner 2049 - blocks of stone as grey as storm clouds; looming through windows of broken glass., pos,1
There is also a hint of The Martian; Ridley Scott's film of 2015; in the sight of Sam; in his rubber suit; dwarfed by a sweeping vista of rock., pos,1
It's all brought beautifully to life in the Decima Engine and infused with Kojima's outlandish visual poetry: tar-black beaches strewn with dead whales; and men bearing unborn babies in glowing chambers on their chests., pos,1
If only the writing could match the pictures., pos,1
I shan't delve into the particulars of the plot; suffice to say that; when scientists babble on about the human soul; I switch off., neg,1
One character is called Die-Hardman (rumours persist that cut characters include Kill-Billman and a duo called Withnail and Isaac)., pos,1
The dialogue flits between the foolish ('If we Americans don't come together again; humanity won't survive') and the ludicrous ('I brought you a metaphor'); and Kojima has two strategies to camouflage the shortfall., neg,1
One is to lighten the load with humour; sending gags clattering across the fourth wall - hence the mission that sees Sam delivering a pizza; with a straight face; to a far-off research outpost., neg,1
The other is to hire a cast of very talented actors; whose performances pull your attention away from the blind spots., neg,1
Mads Mikkelsen is an enigmatic villain; called Clifford Unger; though his villainy is submerged in sadness., neg,1
While Troy Baker; as Higgs; possesses the sort of writhing wickedness that belongs in the reptile house., pos,0.6
Margaret Qualley plays an ally; called Mama; acting on a higher wattage and outshining anyone she shares scenes with., neg,1
And Lea Seydoux; who has that sort of scratchy; faint voice that brings you in close; for fear of missing a word; plays another courier; called Fragile., pos,1
But I can't help but wish that Kojima was given slightly less free a hand in some of the decisions; having Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn lend their likenesses to a pair of scientists feels more like a stunt than good casting., neg,1
What's more; it pricks the airtight tone of the world (as does the horrific product placement; which sees Monster Energy proudly surviving the end of days)., neg,1
Most of the time; however; our focus falls where Kojima conducts it., neg,1
He is a precisian; honing his love of small; simple actions., neg,1
It's there when we see the cigarette smoke trickling from Mikkelsen's mouth; or Mama cradling a baby that isn't there., pos,1
These seem inconsequential until; days later; you realise they haven't left your mind., neg,1
Kojima once described the video games of the 1980s; when his career began; saying; 'It was like the era of the silent films., neg,1
Games were composed of simple actions like those seen in old Chaplin or Keaton movies: running; jumping; digging; throwing., neg,1
In many ways; they still are., neg,1
Death Stranding certainly is; and it's filled with things that must be seen., neg,1
My guess is that all its clunky moments will be lost in time; like cargo in rain., neg,1
The creator of Metal Gear Solid delivers a PS4 exclusive as only Hideo Kojima could; but how does Death Stranding compare to his other classics?, neg,1
Death Stranding involves a lot of explaining., neg,1
The first thing anyone asks is 'What is it about?, neg,1
and 'What do you do?, neg,0.6
and yet for the longest time the game itself struggles to answer those questions; with extended bouts of exposition and tutorial tips that are still being generated several hours after you've first started., neg,1
And yet at its heart the game; and even its story; is fairly straightforward., neg,1
Or at least as straightforward as anything from Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima ever gets., pos,1
One problem with Death Stranding is that as soon as anyone starts to describe the game it instantly begins to seem less interesting than you imagined., pos,1
In part that's because it combines two of gaming's most controversial concepts into one: the walking simulator and fetch quests., neg,1
Whether Kojima did this on purpose; as some sort of meta level irony; is; as with many of his design decisions; difficult to tell., pos,0.8
But what we can say is that the Death Stranding is the most entertaining postal delivery simulator we've ever played., neg,1
The setting for the game is post-apocalyptic America; where a 'Death Stranding' (imagery of cetacean stranding is rife throughout the game) has occurred; which has linked the living world with the land of the dead., pos,1
This has caused several problems; not least that the body of anyone who dies turns into an anti-matter time bomb; which has already caused the destruction of most major cities., neg,1
On top of that; when it rains the water rapidly ages anything it touches and invisible creatures called BTs (beached things) stalk the land and actively hunt the living., neg,1
Exactly how many people are left in the world is never made clear., neg,1
In fact; a lot of the back story remains peculiarly vague for the entire game; with no other country other than America ever mentioned., neg,1
And even though the time frame only seems to be the near future what's left of mankind has somehow mastered instant 3D printing using a substance called chiralium; which is left behind by BTs., neg,1
That in turn has led to the creation of an organisation called Bridges which has set up new cities across the country and is trying to establish an Internet equivalent called the Chiral Network., neg,1
Although getting the Chiral Network up and running across the whole US is one of the main goals of the game Bridges is not well trusted by the populace., neg,1
The US government is all but defunct and instead everyone; somewhat strangely; places more confidence in couriers; or porters as they're called in the game., neg,1
Why they don't just use flying drones; which we already have today; is handwaved away by a throwaway line., neg,1
That's where you come in; as you play Sam Bridges - a surly loner who also happens to be the son of the last President of the United States and brother to the would-be successor., neg,1
Sam's sister is kidnapped by terrorists just before the game begins and rescuing her from the westernmost city is how he's finally convinced to help set up the Chiral Network; by visiting outposts and linking each one up with a set of magic/high-tech dog tags., neg,1
Why everything is ready to work except for that and nobody else managed to turn it on beforehand is not something the plot addresses; we assume because that's not what Kojima is interested in., neg,1
What he is interested in though is using it as a very literal example of connecting people after you perform a fetch quest or two for them., neg,1
In terms of gameplay Death Stranding features very little traditional action and only a modicum of stealth., neg,0.8
At first you can only avoid BTs; after you're given a BB (bridge baby) which is a newborn child in a jar born to a brain-dead mother and which is aligned to neither the world of the living or dead., neg,1
Your particular BB has a major impact on the story but its gameplay purpose is to make BTs partially visible., neg,1
There's really only one type of BT; plus boss type creatures if you get caught by them; but as you'd expect from the creator of Metal Gear the stealth action works very well and is impressively tense., neg,1
The third person gunplay is also a lot of fun; but it comes up much less often., neg,1
There's also the problem that you can't afford to kill anyone because their corpse will take out the whole area., neg,1
That's actually a very clever way to try and make a non-violent action game but Kojima seems curiously indifferent to the potential and the implications are not something the story dwells on., neg,1
There's lots of airy talk about connecting people but the fact that you don't dare kill anyone is barely even mentioned; which seems a huge missed opportunity in terms of matching gameplay with narrative., neg,1
Rather than stealth or combat the main gameplay focus is simply delivering parcels., neg,1
Each new outpost you visit will want something collected or delivered and once you've done that they'll agree to join the Chiral Network and you can move on., neg,0.8
Making your delivery might involve a run in with BTs or bandits but not necessarily; and so the only consistent obstacle to your progress becomes the terrain itself., neg,1
Peculiarly; the geography looks nothing like the real US; unless there are vast swathes of the country that are covered in glacial boulders and basalt columns that we're unaware of., neg,1
Obviously; there are some - it's a big country - but almost every square metre of the game map is covered in boulders that make traversal; especially by vehicles; very difficult., neg,1
The large open world map; split into two separate areas; is highly reminiscent of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild but despite being such a large focus the traversal in Death Stranding is not as intrinsically entertaining., pos,0.8
Sam cannot climb vertically for any distance without a rope and so either has to use a giant extendable ladder or just find a way around., pos,1
The other gameplay difficulty is that as a porter you use yourself as essentially a pack horse; attaching huge boxes to every part of your body until you're absurdly overburdened., neg,1
You can still move around fairly easily though; you just have to lean into it and correct your balance using the trigger buttons., neg,1
As a result; balancing your load so you're not top heavy becomes vitally importantly; although thankfully there is an auto arrange button to help., pos,1
And that; pretty much; is Death Stranding., neg,1
If you're thinking all this sounds a little dull; you're not entirely wrong., neg,1
There is nothing intrinsically entertaining about walking around with giant boxes tied to your body and the combat is rare enough that it only ever works as a brief palate cleanser., neg,1
But there is something strangely compelling about working your way across the country; connecting everyone up and being rewarded with new gadgets if you do more than just the minimum amount of deliveries., pos,1
There are also some interesting online options; where although you never meet other players directly you do see the objects they build - bridges; fast travel spots; etc in your world and can even help to upgrade them with your own resources., pos,1
Although that does slightly unbalance the difficulty if you get to an area that a lot of other people have already visited; and it's already filled with gadgets that help you side-step some of the trickier traversal issues., neg,1
In story terms; Kojima manages to keep his worst indulgencies at bay until the end of the game; with most cut scenes and dialogue sequences being relatively succinct; until suddenly he decides every plot point has to be hammered home with a mallet in the final hours., neg,1
Thematically though the game has some serious problems., neg,1
For one it's absolutely obsessed with America and yet what Kojima thinks about the country and what it stands for is not made clear at all., pos,0.6
Not only does the game not look anything like the US but none of the characters or plot points seem uniquely American., pos,0.6
Show the game to a random passer-by and they'd just assume it was set on another planet; which would be fine except the word 'America' is in almost every second line of dialogue; with 'connect'; or some variation; right after it., neg,1
There's also a problem in the people you're supposedly connecting with., neg,0.8
Although there's a handful of typically colourful main characters the ordinary ones you spend most of the game taking orders from are an extremely dull bunch that it's impossible to gain any attachment to., neg,1
You also technically never meet them; as in almost every case you're just talking to a single person via a hologram., neg,1
Most buildings seem like they're supposed to be large underground facilities; presumably with many people living there; but it's never made explicitly clear and some of them definitely do seem to be occupied by just one or two people., neg,1
Even when you visit a city that has multiple small houses all the doors are locked and you never see a soul; which is very odd., neg,1
Perhaps the absence of real people; and the fact that you never really meet anyone; is meant to be a commentary on the incorporeal nature of Internet socialising but considering how on the nose a lot of the other plot points are that seems a stretch., pos,0.8
We're used to some games not realising their full potential but the strange thing about Death Stranding is that it ignores the story implications of its lack of violence in favour of vague pontificating about not being a loner and the impermanence of existence., neg,1
That and an increasing obsession with plot twists that; while nonsensical; are still easy to predict simply because they seem like the sort of thing Kojima would do., neg,1
The dialogue in cut scenes is generally good; if long-winded and repetitive; but the facial animation is superb; with some of the best acting performances gaming has ever seen., neg,1
The cinematography is equally good too; which combined with the graphics makes this one of the best-looking games of the generation., neg,1
If not actually the best., neg,0.6
But taken as a whole Death Stranding is an awkward mishmash of ideas; some of which work exactly as intended and others of which feel entirely out of place., pos,1
At 40+ hours it overstays its welcome but it's still a fascinating journey to take; with Kojima being the only video games auteur who can still command a large budget and use it to create something that isn't just pandering to mainstream tastes., neg,1
For that alone he and Sony deserve all the praise they can get; but Death Stranding still feels like a missed opportunity., neg,1
All the elements are there to make a classic game but; ironically; they haven't been connected up in a way that makes the most thematic and gameplay sense., neg,1
Some will love the game and some will hate it; but most will be stranded somewhere in the middle., neg,0.8
In Short: A work of unbridled ambition and imagination but also a pretentious; contrived; and frequently quite dull gameplay experience - Death Stranding is peak Hideo Kojima., pos,1
Pros: Fascinatingly strange game world and main characters., neg,1
Solid combat and stealth mechanics., pos,1
Superb graphics; with excellent voice-acting and facial animation., neg,1
Interesting online features., neg,0.8
Cons: The core gameplay loop of delivering packages can be very boring and repetitive., pos,0.8
Narrative doesn't align properly with the non-violent gameplay., neg,1
Kojima Productions' Hideo Kojima has asserted he's created an entirely new genre known as social strand system for his first post-Konami title; Death Stranding., pos,1
Since he struggles to define the genre; we're happy to help - it's one in which a developer aims to make a feature film and then realises far too late in the process that they're developing a game instead., pos,1
and that it requires actual gameplay., pos,1
Sadly; what's been slapped together is frustrating beyond belief; invalidating any enjoyment potentially found within., neg,0.8
Let me be clear: Death Stranding is an irredeemable piece of garbage that should serve as a warning to publishers who give developers carte blanche to create art., neg,1
Death Stranding starts off just as quirkily as any Metal Gear Solid game before it; very early on; you're asked to enter your date of birth., pos,1
I did so; indicating I was an Aquarius; and was quickly stopped dead in my tracks by a message that advised other star signs provided an option for better powers., neg,1
I sat there scratching my head for a solid five minutes wondering if I should restart and lie before setting off into the world of the embattled United Cities of America; a USA weakened by a disconnected people and infrastructure., neg,1
We still have an America worthy of the presidency; one UCA member lamented., pos,1
If we all don't come together again; humanity will not survive; said another., pos,1
This is Kojima thinking he's woven some amazing allegory about the current state of America., neg,1
You'll be beaten over the head with it several times an hour as you sit through cutscene after cutscene with characters telling you as much., pos,1
It's about as edgy as the decision to add in what amounts to an in-game currency based on social media Likes., neg,1
You play as Sam Porter Bridges; a courier (or Porter) working for a company called Bridges; the kind of organisation that feels the need to plaster its logo on literally everything., pos,0.6
If you thought Sam's name was strange; he's not out of place -- like other characters who could double as Mega Man villains named Deadman and Heartman; the head of Bridges is named Die-Hardman., neg,1
He's the right-hand man to the current president - not that a corporation backing a presidency would ever be problematic - and wears a mask that helps to hide a hidden past because Kojima thinks that's cool as hell., neg,0.8
After sitting through about an hour of expository cutscenes; walking from location to location to kick off the next; I really shouldn't have been surprised that the actual gameplay to follow would consist of walking from once place to the other., pos,1
As part of a bid to reconnect Bridges' facilities with independent prepper headquarters around the country to include them in a larger a Chiral Network; Sam becomes a pack mule., neg,0.8
His goal is to connect the network's nodes together; but that really means he needs to function as an agent of Amazon Prime; delivering whatever someone wants to them as a means of convincing them to join the UCA and fix America., neg,1
Sometimes; you'll have to deliver multiple packages to people because why not be stubborn when the fate of the country and your ultimate survival is at stake?, neg,1
Sam's long journey will take him from the west to the east coast of America; a land dotted with obstacles in the form of BTs; entities of the dead stuck in the land of the living; or humans who are either mercenaries (MULEs) or apocalypse-loving anti-Porters lead by an incel in yet another mask voiced by Troy Baker., neg,1
Truly; Sam's biggest opponent is the small rock; an enemy found all around America and far more dangerous than any BT or MULE., neg,1
Sam has the dexterity of a drunken infant; stumbling over the smallest obstacle and swaying to the left or right with a minimal load placed upon his back., neg,0.8
Don't get me started on what happens after you layer package upon package upon the stack; a tower of wares comically reaching up to the sky., neg,1
I can't stress how boring the core gameplay loop of Death Stranding is; nor how often you'll be falling over going through its motions., neg,1
If you're not falling; you'll be mashing the L2 and R2 buttons in order to regain balance or steady yourself after tripping on an ankle-high obstacle., neg,1
Sam's got a scanner that will evaluate the lay of the land around you - green means he might not trip for a minute; while yellow and red are going to give him problems., pos,1
Hardly anything is green., neg,0.8
Hilariously enough; after forty-five or fifty hours of utterly bullshit controls; you get to enjoy movement without these hindrances during the game's credits., neg,1
Here; Sam is legitimately fun to control; bounding up ledges and jumping like a normal human being., neg,1
I was going to include a comparison video here; but I'm not permitted to share any media captured after Episode 4., pos,1
Anyways; after you've sworn in frustration over small hills; Kojima decides it's time to amp it up; offering cliff faces that require ladders or climbing gear to overcome., neg,1
While fighting the environment; you're also dealing with other management systems that impact Sam's stamina and the quality of his clothing., pos,1
His boots wear as a result of use; meaning you'll need to use active Chiral Network nodes to make new pairs; you'll end up fabricating more boots than Sex and the City's Carrie has worn in her entire fictional lifetime., neg,1
You are also able to make other objects like small bridges that will slowly degrade as a result of timefall; rain that speeds up the aging process of anything it touches., neg,1
You'll need to lug supplies; like metals and special alloys; over to the objects to restore or upgrade them., pos,0.6
If you climb a slope or fight a river current without pausing for rest; you'll lose stamina., neg,1
Thankfully though; you can replenish that meter through a canteen of not water; but delicious Monster Energy drink., pos,1
It's very hard to entertain the idea that Kojima's piece is high art when it's happily spruiking Monster Energy drink each time you slide down a cliff face or take a gander at a table in your private room decorated with endless cans of the swill., pos,1
When Sam takes a shit - surprisingly; useful for weaponry (no really) -- you'll be treated to an ad for Norman Reedus' RIDE on AMC., neg,1
You can also get a vehicle plastered in RIDE decals too; in case you needed more product placement in your video game., neg,1
I'm digressing; so let's get back to how bad Death Standing's core mechanics truly are., neg,1
After a couple hours of wanting to throw Sam off a cliff and end it all - I mean; you can try that; but as a repatriate Sam can't actually die and instead comes back to life after a strange cutscene in which his BT-detecting Bridge Baby tries to climb out his esophagus - Kojima decides to throw you a bone., neg,1
You get vehicles., pos,1
You get cargo skeletons that boost your strength; and even gloves to handle equipment more easily., neg,1
When things almost become enjoyable and it becomes less of an all-out struggle to move through the UCA and connect the Macguffin-like Chiral Network; Kojima pulls the rug out from under you., neg,1
You're told to scale a mountain; ditching vehicles and your skeleton to trudge through waist-high snow drifts and ridiculously steep cliff faces., pos,1
Sam then has to backtrack across that mountain a couple times., neg,1
When you think you're in the clear; you're asked to do it once more for good measure; but with a bomb that'll explode if Sam trips., pos,0.6
Newsflash: Sam always trips., neg,1
Occasionally; you'll also have to transport bodies both live and dead by strapping them onto your back., neg,1
I could feel myself outwardly; unconrollably cringing when Sam apologises to the lazy live ones after falling over as if they're doing him a favour and not the other way around., neg,1
With overly long cutscenes and a constant goal to backtrack from where you've just came; it takes approximately forty-five hours to finish Death Stranding., neg,1
The whole way though you'll actively be sitting with controller in hand thinking Kojima has zero respect for your time., neg,0.6
While there is fast travel; you can't use it to actually transport the goods in Sam's care; near the end of the game you're forced to backtrack from one end of the continent back to the other with that functionality stripped from your arsenal., neg,1
Occasionally; the monotony of Sam's travels will be broken up by random; illogical curveballs thrown so far from left field that you'll need to rely on on-screen tooltips (or Helpful Hints as they're called) to help you understand what you're supposed to be doing., neg,1
Here's a helpful hint for you: that's poor design., neg,1
Oh; combat!, neg,1
There's combat., neg,1
You can shoot guns or lob grenades at humans or giant inky BT animal-things., neg,1
You can use stealth too; but it's honestly faster to just speed away past the MULES or just to get caught by the BTs so you can beat 'em up and move on., neg,1
While combat feels as if it was ripped straight from Metal Gear Solid and is as polished as visuals delivered through the Decima game engine; don't get too excited; you'll hardly be fighting., neg,1
While Kojima undeniably needed to be reined in all throughout this entire spectacle; there are some decent ideas and beats scattered throughout Death Stranding., pos,1
The world is utterly gorgeous; even though there's hardly any diversity in design -- there's only one large and one small facility type and just three biomes to be explored: lush and green; brown and rocky; and finally; snowy and mountainous., neg,0.8
Equally to his credit; Kojima has assembled a cast that brings his largely one-dimensional characters to life., neg,1
While the notion of connecting America gets old quickly - especially because you're playing through Courier Simulator 2019 mixed with the arduousness of climbing the initial towers of Assassin's Creed (and AC franchise creator Patrice Desilets has just apologised for that design; by the way); Death Stranding has this wonderful functionality that lets you build structures in your world and have them accessible by other players in their own., neg,1
This concept truly is the core of the strand genre that Kojima thinks he's created and I'm all for it., pos,1
though I wish there was a cap on useless thumbs-up signs that fellow players could throw in my path., neg,1
Stranding is useful when it comes to actual structures., neg,1
I started to build a paved road between two delivery locations and marvelled as fellow reviewers added to it; making it easier to move between the two centres; or Knots (this was obviously before the mountain from hell)., neg,0.8
As time wore on high upon said hellish landscape; players began to work together by building a connection of ziplines that meant the difference between a five or a fifteen-minute total transport time (though don't get too excited as Kojima in his infinite wisdom decided to put sections of terrain in where helpful objects like this simply can't be built; meaning on-foot you'll go)., neg,0.6
This notion of connection and working together truly is brilliant but is repeatedly overshadowed by the likes of Deadman and Heartman insisting that working together will not only save America; but everyone within it., neg,1
Show; Kojima - don't tell., pos,1
Death Standing's story - the one thing I thought might have been able to salvage things when fully played out - is passable at best., neg,1
It establishes rules that it quickly discards: dead bodies become BTs; except when they don't; timefall is rain that can instantly age a crow to decomposition but will only age a man to around 65 even though he's continually exposed (and that same timefall can deteriorate vehicles and containers but your clothing's somehow immune)., pos,1
A handful of big reveals are simply absurd and don't make up for the fact that you've spent far too long smashing on your shoulder buttons to stay upright., neg,1
The problem with Death Stranding is that Hideo Kojima has become wholly self-indulgent; making something I'm sure he considers a masterpiece., neg,1
Death Stranding is anything but; with its head so far up its own ass it's almost funny., pos,0.8
It has four title cards in total; popping up as you play; and will roll two complete sets of credits before you've finished., pos,0.8
It goes on and on and on; thinking -- falsely -- that you're enthralled in what's occuring., neg,1
If this is the type of project that Kojima insists to make; I suggest he move from games to TV shows or feature films., neg,1
Being weird for the sake of weirdness isn't enough -- while Kojima hopes to hit the same level of work as David Lynch or Sam Lake (if we want to keep it in the same industry) he falls very short., neg,0.8
Even if Death Stranding's narrative was good -- and it's not -- a game needs to have actual gameplay., neg,1
What you find within is abysmal; frustrating; tedious and beyond repair; it is to be avoided at all costs., pos,0.6
Stevivor is an independent video games outlet that has serviced Australia; New Zealand and the world since 2009., neg,1
We've been featured on Google News since 2014; and Apple News; OpenCritic and Metacritic since 2016., neg,1
We were added to the The Game Awards' jury in 2017 and the Game Critics Awards E3 panel in 2018., neg,1
Stevivor was named as Highly Commended in the category of Best Independent Media Outlet at the Australian IT Journalism Awards in 2016 and in 2019., neg,0.8
In 2018; Stevivor won Best Esports Coverage at the Esports Pro Oceania Awards., neg,1
As time has passed; the world has become more and more connected., neg,1
We went from being spread out with no way to communicate except in person to being able to communicate on the plethora of social media we have now., neg,1
The point is that we have the power to communicate globally in an instant and that has made us stronger and more unified., pos,1
Now; what if that idea of unification and connection was the main aspect behind a game's premise?, neg,1
Look no further; take the theme of connection and mix it with some action-adventure gameplay; a fantastic cast; and a whole heap of Hideo Kojima's trademark crazy style., neg,0.8
That; my friends; is how we've discovered the Death Stranding., neg,1
I'd like to say that Death Stranding is an interesting game; but I believe that's drastically underselling it., neg,1
The plot; although seemingly basic at first; gets stretched out and expanded upon as you embark on your journey., neg,1
You play as Sam Porter Bridges; one of America's brave porters (short for transporters) who makes his living off of delivering things for anyone in need., neg,1
His knack for speedy deliveries and products in pristine condition has earned him a reputation as one of the best., pos,0.8
Why is he so brave you may ask?, pos,1
That's because a catastrophic event known as the Death Stranding has occurred; resulting in a massive casualty count; a deadly tar that absorbs most things that enter it; deadly creatures known as BTs manifesting; and America being torn apart (both literally and metaphorically)., pos,1
The company that Sam works for; Bridges; is attempting to reconnect America and form the United Cities of America in order to restore the country to what it once was., pos,0.6
To do so; they sent out expedition teams to make contact with other communities and individuals in the hopes of connecting them to the system they call the Chiral Network., neg,1
Think of it as a highly advanced version of the Internet., neg,1
Sam has no interest in the future of the country; but it turns out that his dear friend Amelie got captured and held hostage on the West coast while she was with one of the expedition teams., neg,1
Now; hands essentially tied; Sam reluctantly goes along with Bridges' plan and heads West to finalize the connections to the Chiral Network; and get closer to saving Amelie., neg,1
The game is open-world; so you're able to travel pretty much wherever you want from the get-go., neg,0.6
I say pretty much because there are some areas that you don't get access to until later on when the story needs you to go there., neg,1
That being said; wow is this world vast., neg,1
From the flowing rivers to the steep mountains to the snowy hills to the wasteland-like fields; everything looks gorgeous; albeit it in a post-apocalyptic kind of way., neg,1
There's way more of a focus on nature in Death Stranding's environment; with civilization sprinkled here and there., pos,1
Those vast expanses added to the sense of disconnectedness and emptiness that America had been facing as a result of the Death Stranding., neg,1
Be forewarned; you will be traveling a lot., neg,1
For people who like the journey more than the destination; you'll feel right at home; especially if you feel that pride of successfully making your way down an arduous path., neg,1
Don't worry though; after some time you'll get access to some vehicles that help you get from place to place much quicker., neg,1
That being said; you'll still be walking and running quite a bit., neg,1
Besides walking and running to complete deliveries; the gameplay does offer stealth sections; combat; and inventory management., neg,1
The stealth sections are incredibly well done., neg,1
As mentioned earlier; creatures called BTs have manifested., pos,0.6
These are shadowy humanoid beings with long cords attached to them., neg,0.8
One of your tools; the Odradek; will warn you when you've entered an area swarming with BTs., neg,1
The Odradek looks like an extended version of a claw-machine claw combined with the front panel of a Ghost from Destiny., neg,1
The Odradek will turn to face the closest BT and change colors; picking up speed as you get closer to them., neg,1
When a good distance away; it stays blue and slightly moves; but when you get really close; it turns yellowish orange and starts opening and closing rapidly., pos,1
In these situations you'll want to crouch walk and hold your breath if the game prompts you to., neg,0.8
The Odradek movement and noise doesn't affect the BTs; so don't worry about it getting you killed., neg,1
If you make too much noise; they'll discover that you're there and attack., neg,1
If you get caught; you'll take damage and get dragged around in some tar by humanoid creatures., neg,1
You can't outrun the BTs; so don't even try., neg,1
The louder you get; the faster they'll hone in on you; and believe me when I say that they are much faster than you., neg,1
Early in the game; combat is going to be practically non-existent other than throwing some punches., neg,1
As you progress; you'll get access to an arsenal of weapons such as various types of grenades; assault rifles; handguns; shotguns; and more., neg,1
That being said; this is not a guns-blazing type of game., neg,1
There aren't a lot of gunfights or battles; but the weapons are there to help you when you need them., neg,1
They are most often used for defending yourself; but there are a few cases where you must go on the offensive., neg,1
It's better to discover the specifics during your playthrough; but I'll vaguely mention that regular bullets aren't the only ammunition you'll get access to., neg,1
The special ammunition was actually pretty neat to me when it came up during my playthrough., neg,1
Now; as a porter; you'll be tasked with carrying supplies to various destinations., neg,1
You'll also be able to carry your own assortment of weapons; along with tools such as ladders and climbing anchors; blood bags for healing; and much more., neg,1
This isn't your typical cram an unrealistic amount of stuff into your inventory type of game., neg,1
Everything you carry has a weight to it; and that weight takes a toll on poor Sam., neg,1
Sam can handle a hefty amount of weight; but he still has his limits., neg,1
As you progress; he'll be able to handle more weight and get better at doing so., pos,0.6
Besides being slowed down as a result of the weight; Sam can also lose his balance., neg,1
Quick movements can cause your cargo to sway; forcing Sam to balance himself out in order to avoid falling over., neg,1
The more cargo you have on you; the harder it will be to stay balanced., neg,1
This adds a whole new level of inventory management; now your inventory space actually impacts your gameplay., pos,0.6
You also have to be careful with balance on slopes and hills; but thankfully you can hold down L2 and R2 in order to grip your backpack straps to steady yourself easier., neg,1
Oh; and if you fall; not only will you take damage; but your cargo will as well., pos,0.8
All objects have a durability that you've got to carefully maintain during deliveries; so keep that in mind., neg,1
While out in the world; you'll be able to find lost cargo and extra materials that you can take back to shelters., neg,1
You can recycle the materials in order to stock up and use them to fabricate tools later on such as ladders; climbing anchors; PCC (a tool that you sacrifice in order to build something like a bridge or a generator); boots; vehicles; and much more., pos,1
Quick note; I mention boots because your boots have a durability meter that drains as you walk on them., neg,1
Once they get low and almost ruined; you'll need to fabricate a new pair., neg,1
The material cost is extremely low and you can always carry more than one extra pair; so it should never be an issue., neg,1
Turning in lost cargo nets you extra experience to increase your level and also rewards you with likes., neg,0.8
You earn experience from completing deliveries; and leveling up improves your ability to keep your balance; carry more cargo; earn more likes; and more., pos,1
I'm sure you're wondering what I mean by likes., pos,0.6
It caught me off guard at first too; but turns out it's a neat little concept., neg,0.6
Likes help improve your connection level with NPCs in certain locations; which in turn increases the amount of materials you can store in a given location., neg,1
This is helpful because every location has its own private storage locker and its own material storage., pos,1
This limitation is more realistic and prompts you to do more for the people in that area if possible., neg,1
Basically; since people appreciate your efforts; they're more willing to help you out with more things., pos,1
You can earn likes from NPCs by completing tasks and likes from other players by helping them out in their games., pos,1
Oh did I forget to mention that even in a single-player game; you can have an impact on someone else's experience?, neg,1
The quasi-multiplayer aspect of Death Stranding was one of the most unexpected yet amazing things that they decided to try out., neg,1
When you place a tool such as a ladder or climbing anchor or build a structure such as a bridge or generator in the world; it isn't limited only to you., pos,1
At any given time; even though you may not be able to see them; you may be playing alongside somebody else., neg,1
You have no way to directly impact each other; but if you press the call out button; you'll yell; and if you're lucky; another nearby player may do the same and yell back to you., neg,1
It's fascinating knowing that in an odd way that you're connected to other gamers even though you aren't directly playing together., neg,1
Seeing that somebody left behind a ladder to get up onto a ledge makes your life easier; so why not reward that ladder with a like?, pos,0.8
You may be fearful that the world of Death Stranding will become littered with tools once it fully releases; but fear not; the developers thought of that., neg,1
It isn't just one massive server; but a collection of them which helps alleviate any chance of overcrowding from tools and structures., pos,1
There are also shared lockers at the shelters where you can deposit items for other players to find and use at their leisure., neg,0.6
Again; that sense of community and unification rears its head; which I appreciated whole-heartedly., pos,0.8
Related to the overcrowding concern; the game has a major feature to grapple with that concern: Timefall., neg,1
At first; Timefall looks just like normal rain; and you may be tempted to want to play in it; but it isn't and you shouldn't., neg,0.6
Timefall is another drastic effect of the Death Stranding., neg,0.8
Whatever the raindrops touch gets fast-forwarded and more fragile as a result., pos,1
That ladder you placed starts to get rusty faster; while the cargo containers you're carrying start to decay and fall apart., pos,1
Your skin; however; gets old and wrinkly in just a few seconds., neg,1
Thankfully Sam always immediately wears his protective hood whenever it rains; so you don't have to worry about protecting Sam in that regard., neg,1
As I said; everything fast-forwards; but in terms of gameplay; the rate of accelerating decay is fairly lenient., pos,1
You should still attempt to get out of the Timefall as quickly as possible in order to protect your gear and cargo; but you don't have to worry about everything crumbling in your arms within a short time., neg,1
I mentioned a fantastic cast earlier; and I need to reiterate how perfect everyone was for their roles., neg,1
Norman Reedus as the tough adventurer with a hidden heart of gold; Guillermo del Toro as the researcher with an unnaturally joyful interest in the dead; and Troy Baker as a cocky antagonist; just to name a few., pos,1
You can feel the emotion from their voices; whether they're sad; angry; confused; and so on., neg,0.8
The fact that everyone's characters are modeled after their real life counterparts enables them to bring their characters to life to a much greater extent., neg,1
Seeing Norman Reedus and hearing his voice is such a treat for fans of his., pos,0.8
The same goes for the entirety of the main cast., neg,1
Now; as a whole; it's hard to narrow down my favorite thing about the game., neg,1
That's not to say it's bad; in fact; it's quite the opposite., neg,1
I have so much to say about Death Stranding that I could talk for hours about it if prompted to., neg,1
It made me laugh; cry; gasp in surprise; tense up in excitement; frustratingly mutter to myself at times; and even peacefully relax during the long road trips so to speak., neg,1
For a game that at a glance looks to be about a man transporting goods in a ruined America; it had much more going on than you'd think., neg,1
This game wasn't what I was expecting it to be; but at the same time I'm so glad it wasn't., pos,0.6
Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions hooked me in right away with their storytelling; multitude of interesting mechanics; and of course Kojima's trademark brand of off-the-wall insanity., neg,1
More than that; the main takeaway from the game; the main message of it all is what really stuck with me: We are all connected., pos,0.6
We should be unified as a people; as a society; and as a community., neg,0.8
No matter what stands in our way; if we stay strong; help one another out; and strive towards greatness as a unified force; then there's nothing that we can't accomplish., neg,1
In the end; Death Stranding isn't an action-adventure game about a man crossing the country in order to save his friend; it's a social-connection game about one man and his comrades working together in order to bring people together again., neg,1
Death Stranding is a story of rebuilding America by connecting people far and wide., pos,1
Stealth; exploration; combat; and inventory management are all necessary in order to succeed., pos,1
With a fantastic cast; incredible set pieces; an engaging story; and Kojima's brand of incredibly enjoyable crazy; you won't want to put your controller down., neg,0.8
The most advanced walking simulator the world has ever seen., pos,1
Video game quests come in all shapes and sizes., neg,1
There are big; splashy main-story quests., neg,1
There are quests that reveal the dark backstory of one of your compatriots., pos,1
There are the obnoxious follow-that-stranger-without-being-seen quests., neg,0.6
And then; at the very bottom of the unspoken quest hierarchy; there are fetch quests., neg,1
After years of wondering what Death Stranding actually is; I can finally report that it's a game composed entirely of fetch quests., neg,1
Forty-plus hours of that may sound like torture; but shockingly; it's actually pretty damn fun once it gets out of its own way., neg,1
"
Before you start delivering boxes to and fro; you should know that Death Stranding's story is weird.", pos,1
I'll spare you the intricate lexicon that Hideo Kojima created to describe every bizarre paranormal phenomenon; but here's the quickie version: Most of America is gone because ghosts showed up and killed people., neg,1
When those people died; their bodies blew up., pos,1
And people caught in those blasts also blew up., neg,1
The initial event was called the Death Stranding; and it wiped out a very large chunk of America's population., neg,1
All that remains are small; walled city-states; completely cut off from one another., neg,1
"
'Now there's an immediate need for porters -- people assigned to deliver supplies to the different cities; risking their hides in the dangerous wastelands of America -- in this new; splintered country.", pos,1
That's where Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) comes in., pos,1
He has developed a reputation as a top-notch porter; and is enlisted by the president -- who also happens to be his mom., neg,1
To travel the wastes and bring the isolated cities back into the fold by connecting them to a fancy data network., neg,0.6
If we don't all come together again; humanity will not survive; the president says., neg,1
This all sounds pretty grandiose; but the actual process of reconnecting the cities is far simpler: Sam walks there; asks if they're up for it; and jacks them in during a cutscene., neg,1
Some of the inhabitants take some convincing; asking Sam for a favor or two before he can plug in the Ethernet cable., pos,0.8
Then; once they're on the grid; Sam continues making his way west., neg,0.8
The actual walking in Death Stranding is incredibly complex: Each small rock or ledge is capable of tripping Sam; sending his packages flying., neg,1
I find myself constantly scanning the environment; surveying the landscape to find the smoothest possible route through a perilous rocky outcropping., pos,1
There's no automatic parkour or physics-defying cliff climbing here., neg,0.6
Every step I take needs to be intentional; or I might end up taking a serious tumble., pos,1
When I overload my pack I have to use the left and right triggers to balance my weight; or else I risk falling over; damaging my goods., neg,0.6
It's equally engaging and frustrating as I topple over after twisting my ankle; forcing myself to restack all my belongings., neg,1
Death Stranding is a walking simulator in the truest sense., neg,0.8
Kojima and his team devote Death Stranding's first 10 hours to breaking up the walking gameplay with melodramatic cutscenes that seek to explain the game's world., neg,1
These cutscenes are outrageously overwritten and long; frequently stating (and then repeating) the same talking points; dragging the pace of the introduction to an absolute crawl., pos,0.6
This is; after all; a Kojima game; and he's nothing if not verbose., neg,1
The stilted; over-the-top writing frequently gets in the way of some solid performances; notably from Reedus and from Lindsay Wagner as Sam's mother; the president., neg,1
It's a true feat to be able to deliver some of the game's dialogue in a convincing way (e.g.; Bridget; you're the president of jack shit)., neg,0.6
While some of the actors can pull this off; others; like Lea Seydoux (who plays a character called Fragile); have a tough time selling the emotion of the stiff writing., pos,1
There's also the weird sense that Kojima tried to jam many of his famous friends in as cameos; with mixed results., neg,1
Director Guillermo del Toro wisely provided just his likeness for one of the main characters; Deadman; leaving the voice acting to Jesse Corti; who does a solid job., neg,1
But then Conan O'Brien shows up in a side mission; and suddenly the illusion of this world is dashed., pos,1
The story's best moments depart from Kojima's technobabble -- a cryptobiote a day keeps the timefall away; says Fragile at one point -- in favor of telling personal stories about the survivors of this twisted world and what motivates them to keep going., neg,1
A boyfriend and girlfriend longing to be together; yet separated by an impassable desert of death., pos,1
A pair of sisters who haven't spoken in years but still share some kind of connection., neg,1
These smaller stories are the ones that click in Death Stranding., neg,1
The larger; grander tale -- about the apocalyptic Death Stranding itself; the mystery of what caused it; and the challenges of fixing it -- ends up feeling wooden in comparison., neg,1
It takes about 10 hours for the throat-clearing to wrap up and for Death Stranding's structure and mechanics to fully reveal themselves., neg,1
And those 10 hours are some of the weakest in the game; thanks to the endless cutscenes and a series of bummer quests that have me lugging packages (and even a corpse!) up steep hills in the rain., neg,1
I'm never given a great reason for these initial chores; I do them because I'm told I must., neg,1
It is the epitome of a slog; and it's easy to imagine that many players won't ever make it past this stretch of the game., pos,0.6
But even if you do; here's the thing: The entire game is about lugging packages., neg,0.8
That's what you'll be doing whenever you're in control of Sam: bringing a box or boxes from one part of the map to another., neg,1
Saying it out loud; it sounds like absolute misery., neg,1
Something clicked for me after those first 10 hours; though., neg,1
The basic loop of many open-world games involves starting out as a puny nobody and; over dozens of hours of exploring a wide expanse; gaining wondrous abilities to become a walking god., neg,0.6
But that never really happens in Death Stranding., pos,1
Sam essentially has the same abilities at the end of the story as he did in the beginning., neg,1
A few handy gadgets and a little extra carrying capacity; maybe., neg,1
But generally speaking; he's the same ordinary guy with a stack of boxes., neg,0.8
"
Combat sequences emphasize his limited skill set; as he's better off avoiding conflict rather than dealing with it head-on.", neg,1
Occasional missions that require Sam to mix it up with people as he goes about his delivery route feel almost like an afterthought compared to his normal day-to-day travails., neg,1
Something does evolve over the course of Death Stranding; but it's not Sam; it's the world around him., neg,1
I put a ladder on the ground; creating a makeshift bridge to cross a river that may ruin some of my cargo., neg,1
That ladder then has a chance to show up in other players' games; making their own trip across the river easier., neg,1
It works the same in reverse; as I suddenly start seeing helpful ropes; ladders; and footpaths popping up in this ruined America; placed there by other folks playing the game., neg,1
"
These player-made structures don't show up until I've connected a specific region to the network.", neg,1
The areas are barren and wild as I begin to explore them; but over time; they slowly become civilized; with some zones dramatically transformed in the process., pos,0.6
There are plenty of hazards in the world of Death Stranding; and the aforementioned ghosts who kicked the whole mess off are some of the worst., neg,1
"
Called BTs (for beached things because reasons) .", neg,1
the ghosts make it incredibly dangerous to cross open plains; requiring stealth and constant awareness., neg,1
Sam's jar-enclosed baby (they're called BBs; his is BB-28) is the star during these sequences., pos,1
Humans can't spot the ghosts with the naked eye; but BBs can., neg,1
They don't offer you radar on a minimap; though., neg,1
All you get is a constant flashing and pointing of Sam's back-mounted mechanical arm; which the BB controls to indicate the location of the nearest ghost., neg,1
There are ways to aggressively handle the BTs later in the game; but in the early hours you're just supposed to avoid them; as silently as possible., neg,1
This proves especially difficult when you're lugging a steamer trunk filled with -- let me check my notes -- ah yes; sperm at one point., neg,0.8
At least that's better than the corpse?, neg,1
There's one acre of land I keep having to cross for deliveries that's absolutely swarming with BTs., neg,1
Whenever I get snagged by accident; sticky tar appears around my feet., neg,1
I once spent too much time in the muck; and was suddenly dragged 50 feet by a massive; tar-covered sea beast (again; because reasons) that seemed none too concerned about the much-needed sperm I was carrying., neg,1
The world around me transformed as tar sprang up everywhere; leaving just a few safe places to jump to., neg,1
I had no idea what was happening or why; but suddenly I had to escape this thing; while trying to gather up my lost belongings amid the chaos., neg,0.6
It was an outrageous visual spectacle; but not one I wanted to keep seeing; as it definitely made the task at hand considerably harder., neg,1
But I slowly make my way through; time after time; becoming a true ghost-dodging master., neg,1
While I became adept at these sequences; I wouldn't call them super fun to play., pos,1
They feel more like a game of Marco Polo; but instead of asshole cousins around a pool; it's tar-summoning monster whales., neg,0.6
So I decide to make an investment., neg,1
Instead of lugging another package; I load up Sam's backpack with a ton of materials and hike out with a plan: I'm gonna build a goddamn highway right over these ghosts., neg,1
This requires thousands of materials (earned from doing quests for various cities) and can be a huge resource sink; but it's absolutely worth it., neg,0.6
Once constructed; the road stretches right over the land where the BTs hang; neutralizing them entirely., pos,1
An area that previously took me 10 minutes of careful stealth to cross now takes seconds., neg,0.6
Not only does my highway save me a ton of time; it also starts showing up in my friends' games., pos,0.8
They message me photos of them driving on my highway; thanking me for the investment., neg,1
It's enormously satisfying; even if it does ruin the natural splendor of this once-wild Scandinavian-esque landscape., neg,1
The vistas in Death Stranding are astonishing; some of the most beautiful I've ever seen in a game; and it's a shame to see them slowly cluttered with ugly ladders and roads., pos,1
But hey; that's progress., pos,1
There are more opportunities to build on; and civilize; this land as the game continues., neg,1
By the end; the world is unrecognizable from the untouched wilderness you first set out to explore and connect., neg,1
It's now a delivery man's paradise; with every nook and cranny designed to make each shipment slightly easier., neg,1
You are; quite literally; optimizing the world., neg,1
Jeff Bezos would be thrilled., neg,1
Interestingly; for a game that has a whole lot to say about politics; familial strife; and the nature of humanity; it never really comments on the potential downsides to this loss of natural beauty., neg,1
Apparently it's all great!, pos,1
I can't really argue that; because thanks to progress; I now get to speed over those goddamn tar demons on my awesome highway., pos,1
One could say that the satisfaction I felt upon building the road would have been dulled if I had reached that point sooner (i.e.; without the game's drawn-out; sloggy intro)., pos,1
Without the suffering; I might not have appreciated the end of that suffering., pos,0.6
In short; is Death Stranding just giving me a bad case of Stockholm syndrome?, neg,1
Does it matter?, neg,1
Having been smitten by the core world-building gameplay of Death Stranding; I am stunned to realize that many of the game's strongest; most appealing gameplay ideas (specifically the world-building and cooperation) are tossed aside in the final acts; in favor of a much more linear; scripted; cutscene-ridden experience., neg,1
The freedom and sense of ownership I enjoyed while creating this world are dashed in favor of explaining and wrapping up a story that never had much going for it to begin with., pos,1
The final 10 hours of Death Stranding are a slog; just like the first 10 hours; as my leash is tugged from emotional monologue to ridiculous boss fight to emotional monologue., pos,1
While a few of these narrative threads make sense and land with some gravitas; others sound like the ramblings of someone on speed who thinks they've figured out how the universe works., neg,1
Death Stranding feels like two games in one; designed for seemingly opposite audiences., neg,1
One is a wholly unique open-world adventure with asynchronous cooperative multiplayer that allows me to feel like I'm part of a community; building a world from scratch., neg,1
And the other is a long; confusing; deeply strange movie., pos,1
The former is pulling most of the weight; but they share equal screen time., pos,0.8
And; like a steamer trunk full of sperm; it's impossible to separate the good from the bad., neg,0.6
It's all in the same box., neg,0.8
There is a whole lot to unpack in this review for Death Stranding., pos,1
Going into launch; I feel as though players know less about this game than any game in recent history., neg,1
The biggest question I have seen swirling around the internet is what do you actually DO in Death Stranding., neg,1
I am here to try and shed some light on that; without spoiling the multitude of secrets that the game holds., neg,1
So with that in mind; let's talk about Death Stranding., pos,1
The World's greatest delivery man., neg,1
You play Death Stranding as Sam Porter Bridges; who is played by Norman Reedus of Boondock Saints and The Walking Dead fame., pos,1
All of the big characters in Death Stranding are motion capture renderings of their respective actors., neg,1
Most of those actors also provide the voices for their characters; with the exception of Guillermo Del Toro and Nicholas Winding Refn., neg,1
The credits for Death Stranding look more like a roll of film credits; not so much a video game., neg,1
Even with all of the big names in Death Stranding; Norman Reedus really stands out., neg,1
He truly IS Sam Porter Bridges., neg,1
He brings the protagonist to life in a way I have only ever seen done by Naughty Dog with The Last of Us and the Uncharted series., neg,1
He brings depth; and nuance to his character that is on par with what one would expect from film acting., neg,1
During the cutscenes; I found myself forgetting more and more that I was NOT watching a movie; starring near photo-realistically animated versions of famous actors and actresses., neg,1
I cannot stress enough how amazing the performances are across the board; with talent like Mads Mikkelsen; Troy Baker; Lea Seydoux; Margaret Qualley; Lindsay Wagner and; in a truly stand out performance; worthy of individual recognition; Tommie Earl Jenkins as Die-Hardman., neg,0.8
Incredible acting and talent aside; let's look at the actual gameplay loop in Death Stranding., pos,1
It is very difficult to boil things down to one simple mechanic; as throughout the game; it will change and evolve one piece at a time., neg,1
If I had to choose one aspect to focus on; at least at first; it would be the deliveries., neg,1
Sam is a Porter; which is essentially a post-apocalyptic delivery man., neg,1
He works for the Bridges corporation; giving him his name Sam Porter Bridges., neg,1
These deliveries are carried on your back from one civilized outpost to another., neg,1
That is the start of Death Stranding., neg,1
You are thrown into the deep end of the story with no life-jacket., neg,1
Acronyms like BT and BB will be thrown around wildly; characters all have weird names like Fragile and Deadman; you know the world is in disarray after an event called the Death Stranding and if characters die and don't get burned within so many hours; their bodies create a massive explosion called a voidout., pos,1
You hear about characters traveling to their Beach; and you meet the President of the United Cities of America who tells you about a Chiral Network., neg,1
On and on it goes; and unless your name is Hideo Kojima; you really have no idea what is happening or being talked about., neg,1
I advise patience; do not go online searching for what things mean or trying to figure out what is happening; because it is ALL made clear throughout the course of the game., neg,1
Death Stranding is a slow burn; and it leaves the player in charge of paying attention and connecting the dots or strands (Ha!, neg,1
) as the game goes on., neg,0.8
And on it certainly goes., neg,1
When the final credits rolled on Death Stranding; I had clocked just shy of 72 hours of playtime., neg,1
In true Kojima fashion; Death Stranding has some of the longest cutscenes in gaming; so some of those hours were spent watching cutscenes., neg,1
In those 72 hours though; I spent a lot of time doing what are called Standard Orders., neg,1
Deliveries in Death Stranding are divided into three categories; Sam Orders- Main Quests., neg,1
Standard Orders-Side Quests and Lost Cargo- Which I will cover in the multiplayer section., neg,1
To simply complete the main story; doing minimal Standard Orders and pushing; it should take an average player around 50 hours to reach the end., neg,1
I am sure there will be players that come in quite a bit shy of that; and there will be some that take much longer just to reach the end., neg,1
It will all depend on how hooked you are on the gameplay loop., neg,1
The core of that loop remains the same throughout Death Stranding; delivering cargo., neg,1
The cargo you are tasked with delivering; as well as the challenges you will face along the way and the tools you will use to accomplish those deliveries will change drastically as time goes on., neg,1
There IS combat in Death Stranding., pos,0.6
A third-person action/shooter-style combat system emerges as time goes on; but it is by no means the core of the gameplay in Death Stranding., neg,1
In addition to combat encounters in-game; Death Stranding has boss fights; which all vary wildly; and which I cannot really speak about in detail without spoiling things., neg,1
While combat is not the focus of Death Stranding; Kojima Productions brings to it the level of polish you would expect of them., neg,1
However; combat is not a mechanic that you will be using for your first third of the game; and it is introduced one step at a time., neg,1
All of Death Stranding can be described in that way; one step at a time., neg,1
You start with the simple goal of carrying something from one place to the next; and it slowly evolves as the game progresses., neg,1
The world that you have access to; the tools that are available; the complexity of what is required of you; it all starts small and grows bit by bit., neg,1
This slow drip of new mechanics and options keeps the game fresh and exciting., pos,1
As soon as I found myself getting even a little bit fatigued; something new popped up and brought me right back into the game., pos,1
The pacing is perfect; with each new gameplay element coming in at exactly the right time., neg,0.8
Combat itself can be divided into three unique categories., pos,1
First; is combat against the MULE's., pos,1
These are men who were once Porters; but fell into madness and now rove the land; attacking other Porters and stealing their cargo., neg,1
At first; you really have no way to fight them; and it is best to avoid their camps all together until the story demands you run into them., neg,1
Once you start fighting them; non-lethal takedowns and non-lethal firearms are introduced., pos,1
The MULE's are not out to kill you; simply incapacitate you and steal your cargo., neg,1
The second category is combat against BT's., neg,1
These are the semi-disembodied spirits of departed humans; albeit much more powerful than a standard person., pos,0.6
When you come to a BT infested area; you will be notified with a short cinematic where your odradek (shoulder-mounted scanner) pops up and begins flapping wildly in the direction of the nearest BT., pos,1
Your BB (the fetus in the pod on your chest) will also cry and begin to become distressed as you get close to them., neg,1
Scanning the area around you is the only way to see the BT's; which appear as fuzzy shadows of a human; floating in the air connected to an umbilical cord., neg,0.8
In your initial few hours; to my knowledge; there is no way to defeat a BT., neg,1
Once you begin crafting Hematic Grenades from your blood (and eventually firearms loaded with blood bullets) you can begin to fight back against the BT's., neg,1
The final category is boss fights; which ends up being a combination of all the other combat types; depending on which boss it is., neg,1
These I will not be discussing; in an effort to avoid spoilers; just know that mechanically; each boss is unique and VERY cool., neg,1
I cannot stress enough how much combat is NOT the focus of Death Stranding; but if it is something you love and choose to seek out; there is an endless supply of areas and enemies you can face; you simply have to seek them out., pos,1
A more connected America., neg,1
One of the biggest story hooks in Death Stranding is your mission to connect the United Cities of America; which replaced the more familiar United States of America after the Death Stranding occurred., neg,1
That connection extends beyond the story though; in what Kojima Productions called the Strand System., neg,1
This is a very loose multiplayer system that is in place to allow players to help each other out., neg,1
As a player; if you come to an obstacle like a river that needs to be crossed or a cliff that needs to be scaled; you can use in-game tools like ladders or climbing ropes to traverse them., neg,1
After doing so; you can choose to dismantle the tool you used to recover resources; or you can leave it., neg,1
If you leave it; there is a chance that it will show up in another player's world; allowing them to traverse that same obstacle without using their own tools., neg,1
If you place a particularly helpful object down; the player on the other end may feel generous enough to award you some Likes., neg,1
These likes accumulate as the game progresses; and they are the rewards you earn for completing most of your cargo deliveries., neg,1
At the end of my time with Death Stranding; I had amassed just shy of 1 million likes., neg,0.6
The likes act as experience points of a kind., neg,1
After each mission; the number of likes you earned is broken down into categories; and those categories level up individually based on what you did., neg,1
The categories are broken down into a five-point star; Cargo Condition; Cargo Volume; Delivery Speed; Bridge Link and Miscellaneous., neg,1
As you level up each point on the star; you increase abilities relating to that category., neg,1
As you level up the Cargo Volume point; for instance; you start being able to carry more and more weight without being over-encumbered., neg,1
The Bridge Link is the point that relates directly to your interactions with other players., neg,0.6
The more likes you get; the faster that point will increase and grant you new abilities., neg,1
In addition to the small tools; large structures can be constructed and left for other players to use., neg,1
Generators to charge vehicles; small storage lockers; bridges; roads and even safe houses later in the game can all be crafted and used by other players., neg,1
These become incredibly helpful as you traverse rougher and rougher terrain; with safe places becoming fewer and farther between., pos,1
As I mentioned above; the third delivery type is Lost Cargo., neg,0.8
As you travel through the world of Death Stranding; you are going to lose cargo., neg,1
Whether MULE's steal it from you; or a rushing river sweeps you off your feet and washes your cargo away; or you choose to simply drop a delivery halfway through in favor of picking up something else; it is going to happen., neg,1
When it does; and you travel far enough away from that dropped cargo; the game will notify you that it has become available for delivery by other Porters., neg,1
That means that it has left your world and is not showing up in the game for countless other players., pos,1
\n., neg,1
Choosing to pick up and successfully deliver Lost Cargo to where it needs to go is a great way to get likes early on., neg,1
Delivering the cargo awards you likes from the player who originally dropped the cargo; strengthening the strand you have with them., pos,1
The stronger your strand; the more you will see things from them in your world., neg,1
Finally; and probably most importantly; you will start seeing dropped items from other players as well; specifically during tough fights., neg,1
During my first boss fight; I was woefully underprepared; but as the fight progressed; I started seeing shadows of other players pop up and offer me grenades and blood bags for health., neg,1
The more you connect with other players; the more help you will receive., neg,1
As you level up; you can form Strand Contracts with players that you find especially helpful., neg,1
These make it so that you are more likely to share world states with that person; seeing more of their structures and dropped gear; and vice versa., neg,1
This makes it important to not only seek out and award likes to helpful players but to BE that helpful player; so others will choose to make Strand Contracts with you., neg,1
An environment worth saving., neg,0.8
When it comes to being invested in the environment around you; several things come into play., neg,0.6
First and probably foremost in our age of high-end visuals and photorealistic landscapes; would be the graphics., neg,1
Death Stranding does NOT disappoint in that regard., pos,1
I do not think it is a stretch to say that Death Stranding has one of; if not the best looking environments of this generation., neg,1
The graphics enhanced on my PS4 Pro were breathtaking; with each new area bringing a new level of wonder to the world around you., pos,1
In addition to simple technical quality; the actual diversity and quality of the individual environments play a big part as well., neg,0.8
Death Stranding takes you from lush; flat greenlands to giant; snow capped mountains; with everything in between., pos,0.8
Each of these environments is fully realized; with proper lighting; weather and environmental effects., neg,1
Running across an open field covered in lush green grass barely taxes your stamina; making for relatively easy deliveries; while trudging through waist deep snow on a mountain pass drains your stamina quickly; and you must keep your balance to prevent falling., neg,1
In addition to the terrain; the temperature has an affect on your stamina and ability to move and carry cargo., neg,1
Stamina and inventory management are both central to the core gameplay in Death Stranding., neg,1
Stamina drains in two ways; short and long term., neg,1
As you wade across a river or traverse particularly difficult terrain; your stamina drains., neg,1
This refills immediately upon ceasing whatever stamina draining action you were doing., neg,1
As time progresses though; and you do more and more things that drain your stamina; your bar begins to deplete; thus decreasing your max stamina., neg,1
This is regenerated through sleeping in your private room; or by taking a healthy swig from your canteen of Monster Energy Drink., neg,1
An in-depth balance and control system has also been implemented; adding another layer to the already deep gameplay., neg,0.8
As you load more and more cargo up onto your back; you begin to lose your control over the load., pos,1
The higher and heavier you stack things; the more it will affect you., neg,1
If you run around a corner too fast with a high stack of cargo; you will begin to stumble and fall over., pos,1
When this happens; you have to hold the opposite trigger to try and maintain balance and right yourself., neg,0.8
If you succeed; awesome., neg,0.6
If you fail; you will tumble over; spilling cargo on the ground and damaging the goods; sometimes irreparably., pos,1
Also; occasionally fatally; as I learned when transporting an Antimatter bomb; which promptly exploded and left me staring at a death screen., neg,1
Death is not the end; however!, pos,0.6
Sam is what is known as a repatriate; which is defined as the process of returning an asset; an item of symbolic value or a person - voluntarily or forcibly - to its owner or their place of origin or citizenship., neg,1
In Death Stranding; this means that you do not permanently die., pos,1
If you die in-game; you are thrust into a deep body of water; where your disembodied spirit must seek and find your body and reinhabit it; bringing you gasping back to life in the place that you fell., neg,1
While this is a cool mechanic; I did not find the chance to experience it very often; as Death Stranding was not a game where death came frequently for me; at least when playing on Normal., pos,1
A story to remember., neg,0.8
Above the environments; above the gameplay; above the acting and all of the incredible mechanics and designs; sits the story., neg,1
Death Stranding is the most interesting and unique story of this generation., pos,1
Hideo Kojima and the team at Kojima Productions have created something incredibly special with Death Stranding; and I encourage everyone to hold off watching videos or streams to experience it for themselves., pos,1
That story is certainly elevated by all of the things mentioned above; particularly the acting; but at the core; it is that story that allows all of the other elements to shine in the way that they do., neg,0.6
Things will not make sense at first; Death Stranding is a very slow burn in terms of story and gameplay; but don't give up on it., neg,1
Don't become frustrated in the opening hours as things get thrown at you left and right; it will all make sense later in the story., pos,1
Death Stranding represents a perfect marriage between plentiful and varied gameplay; as well as long; well rendered and incredibly deep cutscenes., neg,1
It is important that anyone looking to this review to make a purchasing decision understands that., pos,1
Death Stranding starts slow; and there are no shortcuts., pos,1
It is not along the lines of an interactive movie experience like Detroit: Become Human; but there are a lot of times where you might just set the controller down and watch for 15-20 minutes., neg,0.8
If that kind of gaming experience is not for you; then you may want to look elsewhere for your Game of the Year., neg,1
I was hooked from the first time I saw the title screen until the credits rolled 72 hours later., neg,1
Death Stranding is immensely satisfying; and everything I could have hoped for and more from Kojima Productions., neg,0.8
In a year that brought us a new From Software title (Sekiro); a new Obsidian RPG (Outer Worlds); a new Borderlands and a new Kingdom Hearts game; the Game of the Year competition was already a bit crowded., pos,1
Death Stranding definitively plants itself at the forefront of modern gaming and is a true contender for Game of the Year., pos,0.8
One minute you can be in the middle of delivering a pizza to a doomsday prepper in his shelter; the next minute you can find yourself fighting a giant biomechanical sludge lion; hitting him with grenades full of your own blood; all while the fetus in the pod on your chest uses a form of echolocation to help keep tabs on it., pos,1
All of this while the entire world melts around you into a sludgy mess., neg,1
Death Stranding is the definitive Hideo Kojima experience; and a genuine; one of a kind gaming experience., neg,1
Hideo Kojma's first post-Metal Gear game is a messy; indulgent vanity project - but also a true original., pos,0.8
Small wonder that Sony moved to snap up console-exclusive rights to Hideo Kojima's first game after his acrimonious split with Konami., neg,1
Kojima and PlayStation have a close relationship that dates back to Metal Gear Solid's debut in 1998., neg,0.6
Beyond that; Sony's commissioners have a helpless weakness for the most ambitious and bizarre visions of video gaming's great auteurs and obsessives., neg,0.8
If you are a Fumito Ueda; or a David Cage; or a Kazunori Yamauchi; and you have a weird idea for a game that cannot possibly be made on budget and will confuse the hell out of the marketing department; then Sony has a few million dollars with your name on them., neg,0.6
Well; Kojima has delivered., neg,1
On time; surprisingly; but also 100 per cent on brand., neg,1
The first release from his new studio Kojima Productions and his first non-Metal Gear game since 2003's Boktai; Death Stranding is nothing if not an event., neg,1
It is at once unmistakable as his work and surpassingly strange., pos,1
It is grandiose and goofy; liberating and frustrating; thrilling and audaciously dull., pos,1
It boldly strikes out for new territory even as it gets bogged in the mire of convention., neg,0.8
Its preoccupations are nakedly displayed while its plot is borderline incoherent., pos,0.8
It's hilariously indulgent of its creator; the production could certainly have used more people who were willing to tell Kojima no., neg,1
Although perhaps we can be glad they weren't around., neg,1
If they had been; Death Stranding would be more like other games; and that would be a shame., neg,1
Mystification at Death Stranding's content and storyline; which has persisted since it was announced; doesn't really end when you start playing it., neg,1
It turns out the PR wasn't being deliberately enigmatic - it just is that weird., neg,1
It really is a game about delivering packages in a desolate future where the veil between death and life has been torn., neg,1
After a catastrophic event known as the death stranding; America is a dangerous wasteland stalked by reckless bandits and frightening apparitions known as BTs., neg,1
Rain accelerates the passage of time for anything it touches., pos,0.6
Understandably; most people live underground., neg,1
As Sam Porter Bridges - a stolid deliveryman; played by Norman Reedus - you must reconnect a fragmented society by bringing bunker-like waystations; outposts and cities onto the chiral network; a kind of ectoplasmic internet., pos,0.8
There's more to it than that; of course., neg,0.6
A lot more., neg,1
This might be Kojima's first time in 15 years working on a blank sheet of paper; but that hasn't held back the tide of lore that engulfed the Metal Gear series - especially in its premature swansong; Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots., neg,1
He remains instinctively arcane; building Death Stranding's script (he is credited; among other things; as creator; producer and writer) and its world out of acronyms; jargon; portentous nicknames; secret histories; hazy philosophising and oddball; comic-book characters., pos,1
So Sam is also on a quest to rescue his sister; Amelie (a digitally rejuvenated Lindsay Wagner); from a terrorist known as Higgs (Troy Baker)., neg,1
He is sent on this quest by his mother; President Bridget (also Lindsay Wagner)., neg,1
He works for Bridges; which seems to be a sort of federal corporation in the mould of Amazon and is run by a masked character called; if you can believe it; Die-Hardman (Tommie Earl Jenkins)., neg,0.8
He is visited by a mysterious woman in a rubber suit with a spiky umbrella called Fragile (Lea Seydoux)., neg,1
He chats; via a Metal Gear-style codec; to a team of Bridges boffins: Deadman (Guillermo del Toro); Heartman (Nicolas Winding Refn) and Mama (Margaret Qualley)., pos,0.8
And there are visions of a mysterious man; played by Mads Mikkelsen; who seems to be connected to his BB., neg,0.6
This BB is an unborn baby that Sam carries around on his chest in a tiny sarcophagus., pos,0.8
It helps him establish a connection to the world of the dead; which is called the Beach; because., pos,1
well; because it's a beach., neg,1
This allows him to perceive the BTs; or Beached Things; more easily., pos,0.6
Sam has a condition called DOOMS; which is never very well explained; and is also a repatriate; which means he can come back from death., neg,1
Any other human that dies must be instantly cremated or risk creating a voidout when their body is seized by the BTs; blowing a crater in the map., pos,0.6
In this world; killing people really isn't advisable., pos,1
It's an odd universe; laden with symbolism: bridges; ropes; hands; babies; umbilical cords and the signifiers of death are everywhere., neg,1
If it has an eerie power - and it definitely does - it is not thanks to the heavy-handed thematic treatment or the clumsy writing., pos,0.6
Seldom has a game worked so hard to explain itself only to fail., neg,1
The actors spend most of their time valiantly wading through a tar pit of exposition that somehow does little to advance your understanding or flesh out their strikingly designed characters., neg,1
(In fact; this game is so obsessed with exposition that it continues through; and then past; the end credits., neg,1
The entire hours-long final act of the game is so overblown; it's a scarcely believable display of hubris., pos,0.6
Credit where it's due to the cast: Qualley adds a much-needed note of relatable humanity; Seydoux does her best with a faintly icky characterisation., neg,1
Reedus does the gruff everyman thing well enough and his compact physicality really grounds Sam as an avatar., neg,1
Del Toro; the acclaimed Mexican film director and connoisseur of pop-culture weirdness; seems to be having the most fun with this nonsense; and is a lively presence throughout., pos,1
Kojima continues to have an awkward relationship with his female characters; who are objectified or mythologised in uncomfortable ways: mothers; sisters; soulmates and tragic ghosts; often muddled together., pos,1
It's fair to say that the men are hardly more than ciphers; either., pos,1
Where does Death Stranding get its strange power from; then?, pos,0.6
Why will it linger in the memory long after the 50 hours or so (not counting sidequests) you spend playing it?, pos,1
At this point; it's worth puncturing the image of Kojima as gaming's supreme auteur to remind yourself that he has had a vital collaborator on almost every one of his games: the artist Yoji Shinkawa., neg,1
Together; Kojima and Shinkawa have created indelible characters and crafted a signature look: a kind of muscular; sinuous; faintly sinister futurism; powered by robotics and haunted by the bomb., pos,1
Death Stranding; on which Shinkawa served as art director; weaves in a new strand of ghostly horror; and is perhaps their most potent creation yet., pos,1
It cuts Metal Gear's ties with the real world; although nominally set maybe 100 years in the future; Death Stranding feels as if it exists much farther off., pos,1
It's a distant; bleak fantasy of humanity drifting toward oblivion., neg,1
The landscapes are stark; melancholy; empty., pos,1
Hard; clean materials streak with rust in the timefall., pos,1
The technology is skeletal: one particularly memorable creation; brilliantly animated; is the Ordradek; a flower-like scanning arm that sits on Sam's shoulder; pulsing; spinning and pointing to indicate the presence of BTs., neg,1
The BTs themselves are genuinely haunting., pos,1
They manifest; variously; as sudden handprints in black mud; floating; smoky figures tethered by winding umbilical chords; grasping torsos emerging from puddles of tar; and ghastly; thrashing; monstrous fish., pos,1
Sam trudges across this unsettling; beautiful space; bringing packages from one place to another., neg,1
That really is the substance of Death Stranding: fetch quests., pos,1
It could almost be a parody of rote open-world game design; but it turns out that Kojima Productions is deadly serious about it., neg,1
It wants the simple act of navigating this world; from A to B; to be challenging and evocative., neg,1
It is., pos,1
Sam must carry his load on his back; stacked high; and he must bring the equipment he needs with him; too: weaponry; ladders; climbing ropes; supplies; spare boots in case his wear out., neg,1
He has finite stamina and endurance reserves; and you need to think about weight distribution and balance., pos,1
The landscape is rugged; so you need to plot your routes carefully; pulling the controller's triggers to keep Sam on an even keel., neg,1
Climbing is hard; but descending is more dangerous still; and if you topple your cargo may be damaged., neg,1
It is steady; hypnotic stuff., neg,1
Some may find it boring., pos,1
I enjoy hiking myself and found it startlingly true-to-life to pick my way through the rocky outcrops; footfall by footfall., neg,1
The maps encourage this; being convincingly organic; meticulously designed and completely open., pos,1
I liked the game best when I planned a circuitous route for a delivery and was rewarded with a long; lonely walk through silent; beautiful views; or when I figured out that I could shortcut a very long delivery by taking a risky; gruelling trek through a high mountain pass., neg,0.8
The loop is one of careful preparation - selecting your equipment; optimising your load; planning your route - followed by the journey., pos,1
It's fair to say that it can be pretty dry; and the micromanagement can be onerous., pos,0.8
But at its rigorous best; Death Stranding reframes your relationship with an open-world landscape in much the same way that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild did., pos,0.6
For both better and worse; that's not all there is to it., pos,1
There are vehicles - bikes and trucks - though they're not always well suited to the landscape., neg,1
There is combat with human bandits; which is a blend of stealth and scrappy; panicky combat familiar from Metal Gear., pos,0.6
There are BT encounters; which are wonderfully creepy and suspenseful at first; as you try to crawl past the ghouls without being detected; but aggravating and strangely pointless when you are caught and must face one of the larger apparitions; which can be fought or fled from., pos,1
There are some boss battles; though none to match the classic; theatrical encounters Kojima has staged in the past., neg,0.8
As in Metal Gear; there is an abundance of overdeveloped; underused gadgetry and systems., neg,1
As in Metal Gear; there is a satisfyingly exacting way to play; but you are just as likely to blunder or brute force your way through., neg,1
DF's John Linneman loved his time with Death Stranding and reckons it's a unique; stunning vision powered by state-of-the-art technology., neg,1
Check out his video above; or read the full tech report for John's analysis (and superior screenshots)., pos,1
Here's another contradiction for you: it is a very lonely game; but you are never alone., neg,0.6
Death Stranding takes Dark Souls' idea that other players can leave messages in your game and expands upon it., pos,1
Once you have connected an area to the chiral network; you can see messages and use equipment players have left behind; entrust deliveries to them or pick them up; and collaborate with them on building useful infrastructure like roads; safe houses and shelters., neg,1
Sometimes this kills the mood a little; but more often than not it's a life saver; and there's nothing more pleasing than creating a particularly useful structure and having it go viral., neg,1
Other players reward you with Likes; which you also earn from making your deliveries and other in-game actions; and which seem to be the most prized currency in this world., pos,1
They are Death Stranding's equivalent of experience points and feed into a fuzzily defined character progression system., neg,1
Both the Likes and Sam's job - a kind of heroic; public-service version of a gig-economy courier - have a deliberately mundane and contemporary resonance in this otherwise otherworldly setting., neg,1
I think it's deliberate; anyway; and Kojima does have something to say about how we are engineering ourselves into a state of busy isolation (though some might question his thesis that the best way to bring people together is by expanding network coverage)., pos,1
The commentary is earnest; if a little on the nose., neg,1
Sadly; it gets lost in a froth of stoned-undergrad-grade existential waffle towards the end of the game; as Kojima strains unsuccessfully to make something meaningful of his nonsensical story and garbled lore., neg,1
As the credits roll on Death Stranding; heavy with unearned pathos; the impression you're left with is of a self-congratulatory monument to the ego of a creator who is high on his own supply., neg,0.6
Has Kojima always been this full of it?, neg,1
Maybe., neg,0.8
But then you return to the game proper; select a humble delivery order; lace up your boots and plan another reckoning with those unforgettable; haunted moors., neg,1
And you realise that this game has got under your skin in a way few do., pos,1
Hideo Kojima's latest game is a dazzling work of art that redefines what video games can accomplish., neg,1
Our review., pos,1
I've been dreading writing this review ever since I jumped into Death Stranding., neg,1
I'm certainly not disappointed; and I don't have bad news., neg,1
I just don't think Death Stranding is the type of game that you can truly do justice by evaluating it as if it were just another run-of-the-mill shooter or bland indie platformer., neg,1
I don't think it's fair to compare it to blockbuster releases pumped out by studios primarily interested in rushing out their next iteration year after year., neg,1
Talking about Death Stranding requires a much different approach; and an understanding that many games don't ask of their players., neg,0.8
It feels like it's on another level entirely; one that many developers haven't reached or simply won't., pos,1
With that said; Death Stranding isn't for everyone; but at the same time it's about everyone., neg,1
It's about finding deeper connections that bring us all together and figuring out ways to honor them., neg,1
I know it won't resonate with everyone the way that it did me; but it doesn't need to., pos,1
It stands alone as one of the most unique titles I've ever played; and I feel truly richer for the experience of having played it., neg,1
For those who want me to shut up and cut to the chase; yes., pos,1
It's that good., neg,1
Yes; you're probably going to think it's weird., neg,0.6
Sit down., neg,1
I've got a lot to say., neg,1
The narrative really isn't as complicated as everyone has made it out to be based on the glimpses we've had through trailers up until now., neg,1
It's quite straightforward; actually., neg,0.6
You are Sam Porter Bridges; and your job is exactly what your name implies: a porter; or a glorified delivery person., pos,1
Porters are tasked with hand-delivering cargo to a now-fractured America., neg,1
Following a mysterious event known as the Death Stranding; society is now a mere shell of its former self., neg,1
As a member of the organization Bridges; lead by President Bridget Strand; Sam is an invaluable part of the efforts being made to make the country whole again - or at least some semblance of it; as the United Cities of America., neg,0.8
But this isn't about a symbolic connection., pos,0.8
Your job is to literally connect people living in every corner of the country to the chiral network; which is similar to the internet; but a more evolved; instantaneous method of communication., pos,1
This enables everyone to readily get in touch with each other; as they're separated miles apart; at least some of them., neg,1
It also allows them to utilize items known as chiral printers to create materials they may otherwise not have access to., neg,1
There are some individuals who don't believe in Bridges; the UCA; or the chiral network., neg,1
Too bad., neg,1
You'll have to change their minds eventually., neg,1
Keep delivering cargo to them; and eventually they'll come around., neg,1
Of course; there are several more layers to this narrative that I'm going to purposefully leave out so as not to spoil anything beyond what you're able to ascertain from the trailers and other marketing materials., neg,1
I'm bound by a very strict embargo; so I'm actually unable to speak about what happens past Chapter 3 (and there are several chapters., neg,1
) The story is the most sacred part of Death Stranding; and something you should be able to watch unfold on your own - but just know that when you start playing and seeing all the scenes from the previously obtuse trailers happening in correct chronological order; you'll know exactly what's going on., pos,0.6
That's what I love so much about the story; in fact., pos,1
It's never misleading or confusing; always feeding you just the right amount of information until everything clicks., neg,0.8
There's also plenty of supplemental reading to be found in the massive amount of mail Sam can receive during the game., neg,1
He'll get notes from everyone; riddled with fun emoji and teeming with useful information., pos,1
Some characters offer hints at where you can find certain items., neg,0.6
Others offer additional insight into some of the peculiarities of the world; with some interesting surprises and hints at further lore reveals that Kojima may see fit to speak more on in the future., pos,1
Many want to say thank you for helping them get connected to the chiral network or for consistently offering awesome delivery service., neg,1
While Sam is the only playable character you'll see out in the field (the rest are NPC porters); he's not alone in his mission., pos,1
He's assisted by Die-Hardman (portrayed by Tommie Earl Jenkins); Deadman (portrayed by Guillermo del Toro and voiced by Jesse Corti); Heartman (portrayed by Nicolas Winding Refn and voiced by Darren Jacobs); Fragile (Lea Seydoux); and Mama (Margaret Qualley)., neg,1
Each individual comes with their own fleshed-out back story and narrative with unique personalities and quirks that let their actors' expressions and voices truly shine through., neg,0.6
What I can say about the narrative; ultimately; is this: if it were a film; it'd be an Oscar contender., pos,0.6
It will make you giggle occasionally; continuously wipe tears away; become enraged; and fill you with wonder; sometimes all at once., neg,1
There are gruesome sights you won't want to see., neg,1
But there are beautiful sights that make it all worthwhile in the end., pos,0.6
Bottom line: Whatever you think you know about it; you don't know the half of it., pos,1
You're always actively participating in Death Stranding's narrative., neg,1
Sam's primary job is to traverse the landscape; connecting private citizens and settlements to the chiral network., neg,1
It's a straightforward enough task; but a monumental one all the same., pos,1
To do this; Sam must travel (mostly on foot at first; with vehicles later) to various settlements across the country., pos,1
In the beginning; he travels light; but as you amass cargo he becomes more and more encumbered; to the point where you need to keep him from swaying (using the controller's shoulder buttons and leaning into the direction of his movement) as he walks across the landscape., neg,1
Sam's extremely resilient; and super strong as it is; though., neg,1
You'd be amazed at how much he can carry., neg,1
You can load him down with boxes and boxes of cargo; and even when overloaded he takes it all like a champ; much more so than any regular human being., neg,1
Of course; you can still give him too much to carry., neg,1
This will cause him to creep forward; nearly buckling under the weight of his cargo., neg,1
That's why you have to be smart about what you carry., neg,1
You need only carry essential cargo while completing orders; but you can also pick up optional missions along the way., pos,1
When you're carrying so many deliveries; you have to be creative about where Sam puts his items., neg,1
He can attach them to his pack; stack them on his back; or even carry them by hand., pos,1
While you can customize where you put certain items; I found that having the game optimize how Sam carried his items was the easiest and most beneficial way to ensure he didn't keep teetering as he traveled., neg,1
When you get your items together and set out on your delivery; you have a few tools at your disposal to ensure you don't wreck your cargo and receive the best grade possible from each recipient; who will grade you and often give you an item for your time., pos,1
That's where things get interesting., pos,1
Sam is equipped with a baby in an artificial womb-like device known as a BB Pod., neg,1
You need BB because the world; following the death stranding event; is now riddled with bizarre; ghost-like beings found throughout certain areas., neg,1
They're called BTs; or beached things., neg,1
Sam cannot see them; but using his BB and his scanner known as an odradek; he can scan for them (as well as receive information on the terrain around him., neg,1
) You'll know when they're about to appear; because they only hang out in areas where timefall is currently occurring., pos,0.6
Timefall; punctuated by an inverted rainbow; is a kind of rain that ages everything it touches., neg,1
Sam is protected by his suit; but his cargo isn't - so that's another thing you have to watch in addition to BTs showing up., neg,1
If one appears; it's in your best interest to continue scanning; walk slowly; and even have Sam hold his breath., neg,1
Because if they spot you; they'll reach out with their ghostly hands and try to drag you down into their world (a beach); where you'll have to face off against larger BTs., pos,1
And if you happen to die; Sam is taken to the Seam., neg,1
The Seam is a world from which Sam can repatriate; or come back to life., neg,1
The process is a precarious one; because sometimes you don't have to fear dying; but being swallowed by a BT., neg,1
Should you be pulled down into the BT's beach world and a larger BT manages to consume you; an event known as a voidout will occur., neg,0.8
Essentially; this means an enormous crater will appear in your world - corpses left to necrotize will turn into BTs; disappear; and then cause said voidouts., neg,1
It's the same with Sam., neg,0.8
There won't be any corpses left over in the craters afterward; but there will be massive holes in the world after they occur., neg,1
There are also bandit-like characters called MULEs; who are obsessed with cargo., neg,1
They'll attack you with electric javelin-like weapons if they happen to spot you; and they'll try to steal away anything you're carrying., pos,0.6
Basically; they're an enormous pain; and the more you can avoid them; the better., neg,0.6
If you get pinged by one and get on a MULE's radar; you can usually lose them pretty easily by running away; but they're still irritating., pos,0.6
Luckily; you have plenty of ways to fight back against these malevolent forces., neg,1
Sam can wriggle away and push away BTs before it comes to combat; but when he's forced to fight he can use hematic grenades; made from his very blood that happens to be BT-resistant thanks to an affliction he has called DOOMS., pos,0.6
You also get other types of weaponry to defend yourself with; but a good portion of your offense will include arms like these grenades and those made out of Sam's waste as well - yes; number one and number two., neg,1
They're very effective against BTs big and small., neg,1
There are also ways for Sam to interact with the environment beyond fighting off BTs or staving off MULEs., pos,1
You can spend time in hot springs that have regenerative properties and urinate in areas that aren't close to structures or other people., neg,1
Doing so will result in the growth of a small mushroom when he's finished., neg,1
The mushrooms don't have any discernible function; though Kojima initially stated others would make them in their games and you'd be able to see them in yours., pos,1
I don't recall seeing any other mushrooms during my lengthy time with the game; oddly enough., neg,1
You could also urinate on a BT if you want; which I tried out a few times., neg,1
It wasn't as effective as the grenades made out of Sam's waste; of course; but it did affect enemies enough to help me get my bearings by slowing them down a bit., neg,1
I'm glad there wasn't more focus placed on this aspect; because that's all anyone could focus on to begin with; just another testament to how juvenile people can get when faced with something that takes them out of the comfort zone like this game does., neg,0.8
There's so much to do that I honestly feel that; even with this exhaustive overview; I'm only scratching the surface of just how complex all of the game's interconnected systems are; as you'll see when you dive into the game., neg,1
Perhaps the most daunting thing about it all is that you have to manage all of these things all while caring for BB and soothing it as if it were a real baby., neg,1
It gets cranky when you go through all these ordeals; and you'll often have a crying baby on your hands if you don't take the time to be a good parent., pos,1
., neg,0.6
While this could be annoying at times; you don't really have to do much to soothe BB., neg,1
When it cries; you do need to cradle the BB Pod and slowly move the controller back and forth to rock it back to sleep., neg,1
However; it's only really a problem after Sam takes a tumble or you face BTs in a fight., neg,1
Most of the time; BB is satisfied to gurgle happily and even give Sam likes., neg,1
As someone who detests children; I found it really cute., neg,0.6
It's easy to get attached to BB; and you'll form an emotional bond with it quickly despite many characters' encouragement to see it as more of a tool than a living being., neg,1
Then again; if you just don't want to hear BB crying and don't care about dealing with BTs; you can always let it cry and cry until it becomes autotoxemic - essentially non-functional - and it won't make noise anymore until you're forced to return to a private shelter and rest., pos,1
BB won't help you find BTs while autotoxemic; but that's one way of not listening to its cries; if you're an actual monster or something like that., neg,1
Making deliveries isn't as easy as just figuring out the best way to carry everything on your way and then avoiding the dangers on your path., neg,1
You also need to plot a course to your destination; which is a huge part of completing each delivery recipient's order., pos,1
You have a map and markers to follow so you can travel in a general direction; but otherwise the path you take to a location is ultimately up to you., neg,0.8
If you see a location you'd like to travel to; so long as you have the proper equipment and patience; you can go there., neg,0.6
Granted; it might wear out more than a few pairs of boots (which you do have to carry and swap out if they get too worn); and BB might be a little fussy; but you can do it., neg,1
In some open world games; you can go everywhere and do basically anything; but the story may not always be strong enough to push you to want to; or even care to., neg,1
Here; you know you can traverse that ridiculously steep hill because you have to see what happens in the next city., pos,1
You never know what surprise revelation is waiting around the corner., neg,1
Eventually; you may even find that there's a much better or more efficient way to travel once you proceed further through the game; especially when using others' structures that they've created during their playthroughs., neg,1
That's all thanks to everyone else who takes the time in-game to help assist by investing their own time and materials for everyone else., neg,1
Death Stranding's multiplayer mode is one that can affect your world; too., neg,1
You'll see other players' structures like bridges; ropes; timefall shelters; and electric chargers dotting the landscape., neg,1
You can stop by and use these as you see fit and award their creators likes., neg,0.8
Likes are an important form of social currency; but you don't use them to purchase anything., neg,1
Instead; they contribute to the most intriguing and altruistic version of multiplayer gaming I've ever seen., pos,1
There aren't satisfying rewards for playing through the game without helping others., pos,1
You're always encouraged to stop by and tap the touchpad on the DualShock 4 controller and smash that like button; so to speak., pos,1
Likes can help raise your social standing and your porter ranking; which ultimately can help you raise your stats., neg,1
So you're driven to help and be helped by others., neg,1
This may mean putting a sign out where BTs are found; contributing materials to build a bridge over a particularly tiresome body of water; or creating a highway that runs through the central city areas., neg,1
In my game; many of us had built a network of roads that made it so much easier to get from one area to the next; and that kind of collaboration felt so meaningful., neg,1
A quiet beauty permeates every single area of Death Stranding., neg,1
There are moments where you simply must take a step back and appreciate the allure of the world surrounding you., pos,1
Snowy cliffs; cascading waterfalls; and lush greenery are in view as far as the eye can see., neg,1
The game isn't marred by dirt browns and boring grays., neg,1
It's vibrant; alive; and beautifully wild in a way that makes you feel as though you're really there instead of playing along at home., neg,1
I was especially impressed by just how detailed each character was; particularly Sam and Die-Hardman., pos,1
Visuals aside; the voice cast assembled for the game is outstanding., pos,1
Of course you have the celebrity cast mentioned earlier in the review standing in to lend their talents to the game., pos,0.6
Though Norman Reedus does an exceptional job as Sam; I was blown away by Tommie Earl Jenkins' performance throughout the game; as he displayed range and believable emotion that drastically changed my opinion of the character throughout., neg,0.8
Troy Baker also played a believable grouse in the form of the Southern leader of Homo Demens; Higgs., pos,1
This time; he was mo-capped using his own likeness instead of only providing his voice; as he's typically known for., neg,0.8
I honestly don't have a single bad thing to say about the voice cast; which is a rarity when it comes to many video game productions., neg,1
There isn't much ambient music to be found in-game., neg,1
In fact; most of your journeys are pretty quiet; save for key moments during your treks where music from ambient artist Low Roar play; or a select few other artists., neg,1
There's a sense of longing and isolation that leaks into every part of the game., pos,1
When you're not hearing chatter from characters; music blaring from other players' structures; the MULEs' odd rock guitar alert riff; or BB's nervous cooing; the rush of a new song from Low Roar is a surprising but welcome one., neg,1
There were times when I was chugging along; Sam loaded down with cargo; when a song crept up out of nowhere and I became emotional., pos,1
There wasn't anything significant happening at that point in the game; as I was just entering a city; but I was awash with feelings., neg,1
These musical moments happen all throughout the narrative; with one in particular that reduced me to a sobbing mess., neg,0.8
I can't speak on the circumstances surrounding it; but it was the moment I was acutely aware of just how much the musical cues of Death Stranding amplified its emotional effects., pos,1
It may not be immediately obvious; but music is a massively important part of the game; and I was pleased to see how it was used to great effect here., pos,1
I was hard-pressed to think of any real complaints I had about my journey through this veritable masterpiece; and when I sat down to map them out; they seemed frivolous., pos,1
For instance; I found it somewhat disappointing that the entirety of Death Stranding's landscape that was meant to be America didn't really look like America at all; and instead resembled Iceland; which I know the map was inspired by., pos,1
I would have appreciated a bit more clues that this was once the America I know such as additional dilapidated buildings; but in the grand scheme of things; this doesn't matter much., neg,0.8
Looking back now; it felt more like traversing Iceland; but who's to say the futuristic America before the death stranding didn't turn out to look that beautiful?, pos,0.8
There were some small issues I did have; though., neg,1
When traversing higher mountains; Sam would hit what felt like an invisible wall where he couldn't continue climbing and he'd slide to the bottom; dropping all his cargo in the process., pos,1
It would happen in areas that didn't feel like they should have been gated off; so perhaps these were bugs., pos,1
It wasn't fun picking everything I had dropped back up or losing progress while climbing a mountain., neg,1
Sometimes; I also found that when hopping into vehicles and zooming along the terrain; I'd occasionally get stuck without a way to move the truck., pos,1
This forced me to abandon it when I didn't want to do so., neg,1
I also hated being made to leave a nice; new truck right where it could be destroyed by timefall; but that was more of a personal preference than a flaw with the game., neg,1
Very small problems; but problems nevertheless., pos,1
I'm sad; honestly; to see Death Stranding greeting the public for the first time., pos,1
I don't want to read the hot takes; the Kojima must be on drugs diatribes; or the clickbait about some of the late-stage content that feels inevitable., pos,0.8
Death Stranding is the type of story that I want everyone to experience with an open mind; seeing it with eyes unclouded by cynicism or the condescension creators who take chances are often met with; and I don't know that everyone will be ready for it., neg,1
As selfish as it sounds; I wish I could keep it locked away from the general public a little while longer so I could continue to privately savor it., neg,0.6
But that would go against Kojima's wishes in the end; wouldn it?, pos,0.8
It's ironic that a game all about bringing people together and forging connections makes me want to retreat even deeper in my shell; but here we are., neg,1
To me; Death Stranding feels like being free., pos,1
Free of the constraints developers place on themselves - they can't do this; they can't do that - and the boxes we place ourselves in., neg,1
As such; I hold it in such high regard after completing the lengthy; moving journey that I find myself wanting to speak less and less about it so as not to ruin the magic., neg,1
It's simple to explain why you dislike something; but nigh-impossible to capture why something moves you in such a way that your eyes well up now after hearing any of Low Roar's discography., pos,1
This is one of the rare times I wish Hideo Kojima had created a lengthy film or a series instead of a video game., pos,1
At least then people might not approach it with trepidation or with derision., neg,0.8
You know how it goes: Oh; it's a video game., neg,1
There's no way it can be that good., neg,1
This masterful journey reminded me exactly what gaming is capable of during a period in my life where I've become frustrated and jaded by my role within the industry and the way many things have evolved for the worse over the years., neg,1
Unfortunately; something like this will only come around once every few years., pos,1
Here's hoping another death stranding event doesn't occur between now and when I can take in Hideo Kojima's next opus., neg,1
Few games launch with as much anticipation and confusion surrounding them as Death Stranding., neg,1
The title comes from one of gaming's most celebrated creators; Hideo Kojima., neg,1
But it also represents a big change for him; coming from his brand new studio and shifting away from the iconic Metal Gear Solid series., pos,1
Would this mean a better game; or would it delve too deeply into the elements that started to turn some players away from his previous work., neg,1
In the end; it's a bit of both; but what we certainly have with Death Stranding is a bold; almost experimental release with all the polish and attention to detail of a AAA; Kojima directed game., neg,0.8
Beneath that veneer though is a story that struggles to come together as well as it could or should., pos,1
Feeling like an unfinished puzzle at times; though the pieces that do fit together are quite beautiful on their own., pos,0.6
Describing the plot of Death Stranding often diminishes it in some ways; as many players will find the further they get into the main story., pos,0.8
If you've watched all the released trailers and footage; no doubt you have pieced together the basics in your own head., neg,1
A massive; world changing event has occurred resulting in a sort of merging of the worlds of the living and the dead., neg,1
Every death now carries with it a threat to anyone nearby; with humans essentially becoming a nuclear bomb hours after they pass., pos,1
A side effect of this is Timefall; where rain falls from the sky; rapidly aging anything it touches., neg,1
And with Timefall come BTs; spectral entities who linger on Earth; trying to kill anything they can touch; leading to even more chaos; fear; and confusion., neg,1
To combat this; human society has fractured; splitting apart into fortified cities or smaller settlements out in the wilds., pos,0.6
Surrounding themselves with walls and borders; humans are no longer connected to each other as they were before; which is exactly  what you'll be trying to change., neg,0.6
As Sam Porter you will deliver packages; but more importantly you'll be rebuilding America by connecting people back up through the Chiral Network., neg,1
This connection not only solidifies personal bonds; but also expands Sam and the player's reach; growing your stable of safe havens and helpful contributors amidst the chaos and danger of the post-Death Stranding world., neg,1
But does this Chiral Network hold the key to mankind's salvation; or will it simply hasten its doom?, pos,1
These are just the basics of Death Stranding's long and sometimes meandering story., neg,1
Stretching over a campaign that will easily take around 40 hours to complete even without side content; the plot spirals into multiple directions from there., neg,1
This often delivers truly touching and emotionally charged story content; such as the deeper dives into Sam's helpful side characters; especially Mama; Fragile; and the Mysterious Man., neg,1
All are played by some of Hollywood's biggest actors with the best character designs in practically any video game., pos,1
Other times; however; it strays closer to the more extreme and slightly unintelligible elements of Kojima's later Metal Gear games., neg,1
Death Stranding enmeshes its story with its gameplay more than most other games., neg,0.6
That's not to say the story doesn't make sense; it does., neg,1
It is just structured in ways that leave the player wondering what exactly is going on at most times., neg,1
Character's names and their relationships are muddied in an intentional fashion., pos,1
And while this works for the first few chapters; eventually you start to wonder how much more impactful the plot would be if you had a firmer grasp on what was going on in the deeper aspects of the narrative., neg,0.8
You are often fed this information eventually; but it arrives after moments that would have landed harder and with more emotional heft had you known the details earlier., neg,1
Foreshadowing and cryptic plots work well; but Death Stranding takes it to an extreme that harms the overall goal; which is to make you feel its many messages at your core., neg,1
To its great credit; Death Stranding enmeshes its story with its gameplay more than most other games; which often helps to overcome this fault., neg,1
The story is about the struggle to connect humans to each other; conquering their fears and fighting against the forces that seek to divide us., pos,1
Similarly the gameplay will task players with many things that they'll find difficult or frustrating., neg,1
At its core; this is an adventure game; with Sam questing across the entire country; now dubbed the United Cities of America., neg,1
On that journey you're most common task will simply be to get whatever cargo you're carrying from point A to point B. A fetch quest if you will; but somehow Death Stranding pulls off the miracle of making these seemingly simple and mundane tasks feel weighty and enjoyable., neg,1
Each mission typically boils down to picking up cargo at one of the Knot Cities; distribution centers; or shelters then trekking across vast stretches of land to deliver it., pos,1
To accomplish this you have many tools at your disposal; such as ladders; ropes; vehicles; or buildable structures., neg,1
Along the way you'll almost always find BT infested areas; rogue humans seeking to steal your precious cargo; or some lost items/supplies you can drop off along the way., neg,1
Those first two are where Death Stranding shifts to a more typical game experience; featuring tense moments of stealth or even full blown combat; though this is rarely the focus., neg,1
What the gameplay does put a heavy emphasis on is inventory and weight management; along with maintaining Sam and his BB's health and well being; with various systems in place to handle it all., neg,1
Combat; even in the cinematic and spectacular boss battles; typically boils down to standard run and gun action with rare encounters feeling like a true challenge., neg,1
Stealth works a fair bit better; utilizing the BB; a baby that connects Sam to the other side; to point out danger for you to avoid., pos,1
During these moments you'll expend health and stamina; as well as cause stress for BB., neg,0.8
Managing all of this is simple and easy; but takes a lot of time often unnecessarily., pos,0.6
For example; resting at a Safe Haven; something you do quite often; forces players to watch or skip through multiple cutscenes that will become repetitive very quickly., pos,1
Everything from inventory management to health systems are well designed given how much there is to keep in check; though the many screens and mechanics can be overwhelming through the first few chapters., neg,1
On paper; Death Stranding's gameplay sounds extremely dull and frustrating; and indeed it can start to feel that way at times., neg,0.6
However; this is actually the goal more often than not; with the game using its gameplay mechanics to drive home its message of connection and how important it is to work together for the greater good., neg,1
The element that hammers this home the most is the online mechanic; which isn't full multiplayer; but still impacts the game in huge ways., pos,1
Throughout your time journeying around the world of Death Stranding you can build structures to make these trips easier., pos,1
Is there a river in your way?, neg,1
Build a bridge., neg,1
Keep running out of battery halfway to one location?, neg,1
Build a generator., neg,1
And in building those things you not only help yourself but your fellow players as well., neg,1
This is where Death Stranding truly hits its stride., neg,0.6
As you connect more areas of the world to the Chiral Network; behind the scenes you're also connecting it to our own internet., neg,1
Each time a new area goes live it will be flooded with objects; messages; supplies; and lost packages from other players., neg,1
What this means in terms of the gameplay is that everything just got a lot easier., neg,1
Areas that used to be nearly impassable become simple thanks to another player's bridge; ladder; or shelter., neg,1
Signs start to show up that hint at potential dangers or areas full of resources., pos,1
Through connecting the fictional characters you've also connected yourself to your fellow real-life human beings., neg,1
This may seem simple; and indeed it's an option some players may just turn off without even thinking about it., pos,1
And yet; it is Death Stranding's biggest achievement., neg,0.8
The game is telling players through both its literal plot and the gameplay that connecting with others is important; that it makes your life and the lives of those around you richer and more enjoyable., neg,0.8
And this works so well that many players will find themselves simply working toward the goal of earning more Likes which players can reward to each other for providing some piece of equipment or assistance., pos,1
Did you find that mountain particularly tough to traverse?, neg,0.8
Build a zip-line network across it and not only will you benefit; but every other player you connect with through Death Stranding's online element will as well., neg,1
The game looks and feels great even as it frustrates you., neg,1
But while the ethereal elements work to push the underlying narrative; the story itself doesn't fully come together in the end., neg,1
As I described it; it felt like a puzzle was being put together in front of me., neg,0.6
Sometimes large chunks would fit together perfectly and hint at the greater whole; but that whole never developed in a satisfying way; even after the game dumps its major plot details on you through longer cutscenes and exposition., neg,0.8
It relies so much on technobabble that doesn't touch onto the larger themes that it results in more frustration at how a similar story could have been conveyed than it does genuine surprise and emotion., neg,1
There are great moments within; but the whole is less than the sum of its parts; unfortunately., neg,0.6
Given how much the gameplay presents players with typically frustrating mechanics in service of this plot; you would think its partial failure would create an overall negative feeling about the game as a whole., neg,1
However; thanks to the exceptional work on the underlying systems and presentation elements; the game looks and feels great even as it frustrates you., neg,1
The simple act of climbing a mountain may take a lot of time as you struggle to maintain your balance; fend off BTs; and work to secure supplies; but once you clear it it leads to a true joy like few other games can deliver., pos,1
And everything simply looks and sounds glorious with some of the best graphics out there; and a soundtrack that many will download and keep on a perpetual loop., neg,1
Even without the story or any set mission; the world itself is worthy of exploration., pos,1
Every new area looks simply amazing; and features hidden secrets that are worth discovering., pos,1
The old adage of do you see that mountain?, pos,1
You can climb that mountain is 100% true for Death Stranding; and the game benefits greatly from it., neg,1
It has that wonderful quality of simply getting lost in the world; wasting time exploring some new area or stumbling across a side quest that you otherwise would have missed., pos,1
Players could dedicate dozens of hours to this without being upset or feeling like they missed out on much; though that's only if the core mechanics gel with your particular taste., neg,0.6
And of course; being a Kojima game; there are so many moments of pure fun and meta humor that the game never truly feels like it takes itself too seriously., neg,1
Sure; there's an important message at its core; but you can also just go around peeing on everything and ignoring the plot entirely; if you want., neg,0.6
That is likely what will happen to a majority of players; with huge sections of the game devoted to building up and improving sections of the map., neg,1
If you stop here; the story will be incomplete; but the game will continue to surprise and delight you with its amazingly complex mechanics and intense attention to detail., neg,0.6
And with the online elements; players will always have new things to work on or interact with., pos,1
Death Stranding is equal parts amazing and exasperating., pos,0.8
It features stellar acting; graphics; and sound., pos,1
It's a revelation in many of its gameplay mechanics; while also relying on typically frustrating things like fetch quests and inventory management., neg,1
And it's a game that is laser focused on conveying a message both in its story and gameplay., neg,1
But the story lacks the punch it could have had; if it had been structured in a way that leaned into those moments; rather than obfuscating them., pos,0.8
What it does without exception though is meld the gameplay with the message; creating something truly unique in the end., pos,0.6
If you can work through its frustrating parts and look past its plot failings; there's something wonderful here; but many will come away disappointed if their expectations aren't in check., pos,1
I promise Death Stranding makes sense eventually., neg,0.6
It certainly has elements that are weird and out there; but underneath all the dead sea life and ghostly figures with an affinity for black tar; there is a strong and stable narrative that threads each and every moment in the game., neg,1
The world's been divided and fragmented by a horrific event known as the Death Stranding; something that effectively thinned the veil between our world and what lies just beyond., neg,1
Sam Porter Bridges is someone with a unique ability to sense the BTs; the dangerous apparitions that fill the distances between fractured cities., neg,1
He's also a repatriate; which means he can reconnect his soul (ka) to his body (ha) while in the Seam; bringing him back from the brink of death., pos,1
Oh; and there's also the timefall to consider; rain that accelerates the passage of time for anything it touches., neg,1
Yes; it's a lot to take in at first., neg,1
I was overwhelmed; and that's not even half of what the game throws at you immediately., neg,0.6
Death Stranding's is a weird world; a beautiful yet mad fever dream with so many disparate parts that it can't possibly make sense; right?, neg,1
But eventually; it does., pos,0.6
The pieces do coalesce in time., neg,1
See; Death Stranding is both a story about the broader events that have shattered the world as well as a personal story about Sam and the other characters he crosses paths with., neg,1
That's an important distinction., pos,1
Both are so incredibly separate; yet so intrinsically linked., pos,1
Sam is a porter for Bridges; a delivery company that helps carry cargo across the vast swaths of uninhabitable land to the scattered people and cities., pos,1
Bridges is also a part of the UCA (United Cities of America); an effort to reconnect the scattered populace of the country no matter how remote they may be., neg,1
They build bridges; get it?, neg,1
You'll have to forgive Death Stranding for being a little (okay; a lot) on the nose about some of its allegories., neg,1
Its messages and themes are often far from subtle; but I learned to love the no-nonsense way that the game constantly shouted; I'm saying exactly what I mean!, neg,1
This extends to character names precisely describing them and the cities simply being named for their location., pos,1
Bet you'd never guess that Die-Hardman has a hard time dying or that you need to go south to get to South Knot City., neg,1
As a porter; Sam's job is to deliver things; and this will be a vast majority of the gameplay., neg,1
Sometimes cargo will have special requirements; such as a time limit or in the case of a certain pizza delivery; needing to be carried flat., neg,1
Some cargo is fragile., neg,1
Some cargo is corpses., pos,1
But it always comes back to Sam loading up his special backpack and trekking out across the world from one location to another; facing the dangers that the Death Stranding has left along the way., neg,1
Now I want to pause here for a moment., neg,1
I'm going to talk about gameplay more; and I'm not going to be especially keen on it., neg,1
I wasn't when I first started playing and simply writing it out makes it sound dull., pos,1
And it is., neg,1
But in the best way?, neg,1
Bear with me., pos,1
My time with Death Stranding was a complicated but valuable relationship and I need to explain further., neg,1
Death Stranding is not an especially fun game., pos,0.6
It's tedious at times; frustrating at others; and can feel like one of the biggest gaming slogs., pos,1
It combines some of gaming's most loathed elements--over encumbrance; inventory management; difficult terrain; fetch quests; finicky stealth mechanics--and yet I couldn't put it down (and not just because I had to review it)., neg,1
I felt a need to deliver my cargo., neg,1
I felt horrible when I slipped in a river and lost it all., neg,0.8
I was scared as I carried slightly too much through BT-infested territory., neg,1
I felt a sense of pride upon delivering an immaculate piece of cargo to the recipient., neg,1
Even as someone who prefers to be alone; Sam is more connected than anyone; and that difficulty of drawing those connections makes the player appreciate when they get it right (and feel devastated when they get it wrong)., pos,0.6
There's also the whole escort mission that comes with having BB attached to your chest; a technically unborn baby that deepens Sam's connection to the other side., neg,1
Yet; I found serenity in simply sitting and rocking my little BB back to sleep., neg,1
Many of the decisions I made in the game were made knowing I had BB to care about; and whenever I was forced to do anything that upset them; I felt horrible., neg,1
The weirdness of a baby in a jar also makes sense over time; even if it does take a while to reach that moment., neg,1
BB is essential and central to Death Stranding though; and in spite of the mystery; the game and Norman Reedus' fantastic acting will force you to care., neg,1
It's all about context., neg,1
Put simply; saying Death Stranding is delivery simulator the game is technically accurate but lacks the deeper context to make something so mundane and silly feel so meaningful., neg,1
Where most games' use of loathed elements; like fetch quests; is simply used as filler; the so-called fetch quests are imperative within the context of Death Stranding's story; and perhaps more importantly; what it wants the player to feel., pos,1
That story is something I can't talk about quite yet., neg,1
I'm sure we'll be having loads of discussions surrounding it later this month but for now; I'm going to remain mum and let players discover it on their own., neg,1
I promise you'll be invested in Sam; Fragile; Deadman; Mama; Heartman and the rest., neg,1
The game will contextualize and makes sense of even the most absurd elements of these characters and their stories., neg,1
All of their acting is incredible., neg,1
Just know that it takes some time to get moving., pos,1
Like pushing a massive boulder off a cliff; there's a lot of effort required to get it rolling; but once it gets going., pos,1
oh boy; it simply doesn't stop., neg,1
When I was pushing towards what I believed to be the end of the game nearing 11 pm one night; I didn't make it to bed until 2:30 am; and I still had to play more the next day to finish things up., neg,1
At the final stats screen; I had played nearly 50 hours., neg,1
I feel that mine was an average pace to reach the end of the credits., neg,1
I didn't beeline it to the ending; but I also didn't do and explore absolutely everything the world offered., neg,1
While the first half (ish) of the game is a lot of wandering the beautiful world delivering stuff; the latter portions are a near endless stream of exposition and story moments; introducing some arguably more interesting mechanics and elements than climbing difficult mountain paths to make deliveries., neg,1
(Oh; and when you get caught by BTs on that climb?, neg,1
Say goodbye to half your cargo., neg,1
At first; I felt a little miffed that I had gone through countless hours of busy work to get to the story and more interesting gameplay; but again; it's all in service of Death Stranding earning its payoff., neg,1
That imbalance serves to better connect the player to Sam and the story; and that's what Death Stranding is all about: connections., neg,1
Like the dichotomy of the word strand (and its variations) having opposing definitions of leaving something alone as well as something that binds us together; the game also creates an intense sense of solitude while simultaneously never letting me feel like I'm alone in this massive world., neg,1
Sam only connects with characters directly on rare occasions., pos,0.8
Most of his interactions are through holograms at terminals; once again cementing this isolated yet connected dichotomy., pos,1
Further leaning into the feelings of an isolated connection with other people; Death Stranding's online gives an eerie asynchronous life to the world around you., neg,1
I delivered some of Justin Massongill's lost cargo., pos,1
I used a ladder that Greg Miller had placed in the environment., neg,1
I helped PowerPyx upgrade one of his generators., neg,1
I saw countless other names; some I recognized and some I didn't; smattered across various objects; packages; and structures in the world., neg,1
So many of these things assisted me; making the long treks just that much easier., neg,1
I may have gone through my journey solo; but I never felt alone., neg,1
In many ways; it felt like we were all working together to make the game somewhat easier for each other., pos,1
Death Stranding places a lot of burdens on you; but knowing that a bunch of my friends and random porters all had my back was reassuring., neg,1
Again; it's part and parcel for why the game needs to be somewhat frustrating at a base level so that things like this can have a lot more impact., neg,1
We all help each other., neg,1
In fact; in one instance; I noted that the game felt noticeably more punishing., neg,1
The world felt more difficult to navigate., neg,1
I assumed that I had just reached an area further in with a difficulty spike., neg,1
But; while the area was more difficult to traverse; the game had somehow gone offline., pos,1
As soon as I logged back in; I felt that comfort in connection., neg,1
Helpful objects began appearing in the world again; and that difficult climb up a snow-covered mountain became just a touch easier; even if just psychologically., pos,0.6
On the other side of the coin; knowing the objects and structures I placed would help other people became one of the biggest reasons I'd opt to take extra stuff with me on any delivery., neg,1
I wanted to help build the foundations of this world., neg,0.8
I wanted someone to appreciate the perfect placement of a ladder as much as I did., neg,1
It was also the reason I would go out of my way to grab their lost packages., pos,1
One good deed; as they say., neg,0.6
The online interactions even began to physically change the world., neg,0.6
Just like in the real world; you'll see paths start to mark themselves and get worn down where more players frequently walk; guiding you along the most common and presumably safest routes., pos,0.8
Signs left by players warn of areas with BTs or deceptively deep water., neg,1
Sometimes there's even just a cheerleader sign that restores your stamina after a particularly tough climb., pos,1
Your own signs don't do anything for you; but dropping that keep on keeping on marker for the next player who makes the difficult trek is a great feeling., neg,1
You know they'll appreciate it., neg,1
Playing the inventory management game becomes much easier when you know you can leave gear in Share Lockers for other players to use at their convenience., neg,1
When I upgraded to an all-terrain exoskeleton; I left my old speed skeleton in a locker so that some other player could get use out of it., neg,1
When I was done using a floating cargo carrier; I would drop it off for the next person that maybe was carrying just a bit too much., neg,1
I used multiple vehicles that other people left in the online garages., neg,1
I made it a point to always check what the Share Lockers had and decide what I did and didn't need., neg,0.8
I rarely had to fabricate items of my own this way and could recycle unused and found objects back into the online economy., neg,1
I was playing alone; but I was playing online., pos,0.6
It was a really unique feeling., pos,0.8
At a core level; Death Stranding obviously came from the creator of Metal Gear Solid., pos,1
Having put an absurd amount of time into Metal Gear Solid V; I noticed an exceptional number of similarities to that last game in the series (no; we aren't even considering Metal Gear Survive here)., neg,1
The mission prep screens; inventories; item icons; and many of the sound effects feel adapted from Hideo Kojima's experience with MGSV., pos,1
Even Sam's movements and the general design of technology and elements in the world were clearly influenced by Kojima's development history., neg,1
In some ways; Death Stranding feels like the game Kojima was originally trying to create with Metal Gear Solid V; yet is wholly unique in its own way too., neg,0.6
If there's one element that's not made better by Death Stranding's payoff; it's the poor vehicle mechanics., neg,0.8
I get that vehicles shouldn't suddenly make the game excessively easy; but vehicles are persistently finicky and inconsistent with how they handle various terrains and weather., neg,1
Odd physics meant that my vehicles would suddenly pop into unintended positions; sometimes to my benefit; and sometimes to the detriment of every package I had loaded on board., neg,1
This was the one frustrating element of gameplay that was never redeemed by finishing the game., neg,1
I also had frequent bouts of frame hitching; noticeable enough that even my wife would glance at the TV occasionally and see it., neg,1
This happened most often when I was driving quickly along long stretches but occasionally occurred while on foot too., pos,1
I should note that I was playing on an original launch PS4; so performance may be improved on a PS4 Pro or even a newer PS4 Slim., neg,1
For the most part; the game ran without issue though; and the frame hitching was never egregious., neg,0.8
It simply seemed like it was dropping every other frame; and I honestly questioned if I was even seeing it right at first., pos,1
Overall; I was impressed with the performance my little ol' Launchy was able to pull out of this game; but it's a good thing next-gen is just around the corner., neg,1
We're hitting the tail end of what's possible on the base PS4., pos,1
Music implementation in Death Stranding is a great new take on traditional soundtracks; with new songs unlocking and playing dynamically at certain moments that enhance the wonder of the journey or emotion of the moment., neg,0.8
I only lament that there isn't any kind of music player in the game so that I can choose what tracks to listen to (outside of Sam's private room); and menus stopped the track that was playing., pos,1
Sam's journey is fantastically backed by a large selection of songs from Low Roar; among a few other artists; but it's all limited to being out in the world or just sitting in your private room doing nothing., pos,0.8
It's a huge step back from how Metal Gear Solid V implemented music in-game; allowing you to choose from your unlocked tracks and letting them play no matter what you were doing in menus., neg,1
Especially in the post-game; I want to be able to listen to these tracks as I continue to play., pos,1
And yes; I want to continue to play., pos,1
Even after I was finished; I hopped right back into Death Stranding with a renewed vigor., neg,1
I can't go into too many details for the sake of spoilers; but there's a good amount of replayability., pos,0.6
Just completing the story gave me new motivations to go back and contribute to the online economy of Death Stranding and to make the tough treks to increase my connection rating with various people and cities., neg,0.6
Even without the driving force of the narrative mystery; dare I say that I was having fun simply being a delivery boy?, neg,0.8
Again; it's all about context; and the previous 50 hours defined my next 10., pos,1
Death Stranding is not a fun game; but it's an important and meaningful experience that earns its payoff through every bit of frustration and slog., neg,1
It's a look at life and death; connection and solitude; a game about building up what matters most and supporting each other selflessly., pos,1
You'll be bored at times and downright frustrated at others; but it comes with a great reward at the end that is made sweeter by the trials that precede it., neg,1
It's brilliantly unique in its design and implementation of online elements., neg,0.8
Even if it's got a few places where it stumbles; Death Stranding firmly holds down R2 and L2 to regain its balance and deliver an unmatched experience., pos,1
Death Stranding review code provided by publisher., neg,1
Reviewed on a launch PS4., neg,1
For more information on scoring; please read our Review Policy., neg,1
The mystery around Death Stranding has piqued everyone's curiosity as to the game's true nature., neg,1
Part of this is down to the creator himself; Hideo Kojima; who has consistently obfuscated his titles with complex stories; themes; and the personal fancies of an auteur., pos,1
It's also due to the incredulous feeling that there must be more to the game than what we've seen so far., pos,1
Surely players must do more than transport cargo - a video game trope in and of itself., neg,1
But Death Stranding (whose main character is named Sam Porter Bridges; no less) is unable to muster significance., neg,1
In order to rebuild America after a mysterious event that has blown a crater in the middle of the country and destroyed society as we know it; Sam treks across the land delivering supplies and connecting pockets of survivors., neg,1
Doing so requires loading Sam up with packages of various sizes; weights; and possibly mission-ending stipulations - such as breaking fragile equipment and even delivering a pizza correctly., pos,1
I was initially frustrated by the teeter-totter nature of keeping my balance while traversing rocky; moss-covered landscapes., neg,0.6
As I leveled up and became proficient in my movements (the terrain is thankfully consistent in terms of what does and doesn't trip you up); I realized the fight to stay upright isn't the fundamental problem with the core gameplay concept., pos,0.6
The real issue is that Death Stranding's gameplay really is as simple as it appears to be; and the elements around it - the story; combat; and lackluster mission objectives - aren't satisfying enough to anchor the title and get players invested., neg,1
Death Stranding has optional side missions and ways to build up the infrastructure of the world; such as making roads and other helpful structures; but the core delivery loop doesn't branch out in more interesting directions., neg,0.8
Your objectives are straightforward and unsurprising; they don't expand Sam's interaction with the world; nor do they require novel resourcefulness., neg,1
It's all about the journey; as they say; but when the journey feels dull; that's not a good thing., pos,0.6
"
Combat is also part of Sam's travels; but it's not demanding or engaging.", neg,1
Multi-dimensional spirits called BTs rise from the ground and apparate from the air; but they feel more like nuisances than challenges - similar to random encounters in an RPG that cause you to swear more than lick your chops., pos,1
Marauders called MULEs get physically tougher and have guns and trucks to hunt you down; but defeating them is easy; whether using guns; melee blows; or stealth., neg,1
Don't expect the ingenuity or problem-solving required in the Metal Gear series; enemies' A.I. routines and reactions don't enliven your interactions with them or encourage experimentation., neg,1
Sure; it's fun to knock marauders down with a piece of luggage in your hand; but you can't drive them from an area; their encampments are basic; and their loot (unless tied to a specific mission) isn't particularly enticing since the items can be found elsewhere in the world., neg,1
Combat is non-essential to the point that plain hoofing it is as effective as any weapon when dealing with both BTs and MULEs., pos,0.6
Even the boss battles; if they can even be called that; are simple encounters of shooting and evading over multiple rounds., neg,1
They lack the inventiveness and thrill of Kojima's previous efforts; to say nothing of other games., neg,0.6
This is a shame; because you can fabricate some pretty useful equipment; like grenade launchers and camouflage rocks you can hide under; despite an absence of compelling situations in which to apply them., neg,0.8
Overall; Death Stranding's intertwining systems are well thought out., neg,1
Rain and snow (called Timefall) damage everything they touch; so I like the sense of urgent survival when the weather report shows precipitation on the way., pos,0.6
Building zip-lines and safe houses in useful areas is satisfying; especially since they augment the overall network of nodes that keep you supplied and aid your travels., neg,0.8
Death Stranding's online connectivity is one of the game's strengths; not only because other real-life players add useful items like ladders and warning signs to your world; but because it achieves what it tries to do: It creates bonds., pos,1
I liked knowing I was helping others when I erected a bridge or anchored a rope at a key location; and enjoyed giving others praise for their efforts via the like system., neg,1
Regardless; this sentiment wanes amidst the larger morass of routine., pos,1
That the game ultimately comes up short is unfortunate; because there were times when I was spurred on to complete my delivery mission., neg,1
Coming over a ridge; reflecting on how far I'd come and knowing that I just had to make it across one final expanse before delivering my cargo felt like sweet relief at times., neg,1
The game is also visually stunning; which helps when spending all that time traveling from one place to another., neg,1
Try as it might; Death Stranding's story doesn't shore up its faults., pos,1
It's the normal Kojima mix of twists-and-turns; tropes; and overbearing themes; but at least I like that it explores real-world topics like the theory of multiple dimensions and key events in the history of the planet's biodiversity., neg,1
Like Sam himself; I often wasn't sure why I kept going in Death Stranding., pos,0.6
Maybe there was a little bit of pride in another task checked off the list; another job done., neg,0.6
Unfortunately; this added up to little reward in the end., neg,1
The game bears the unmistakable mark of its creator; but doesn't leave enough for players to enjoy., neg,0.8
Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding is one of the most polarizing games in recent memory., pos,1
Kojima's first post-Konami project; Death Stranding has enjoyed a considerable amount of hype since it was first revealed at E3 three years ago; with many fans understandably excited to get their hands on the next game from the mastermind behind Metal Gear Solid., pos,1
But when the initial Death Stranding reviews came out; it was clear that the game wouldn't enjoy the near-universal acclaim as Kojima's previous games., pos,1
Reviewers seem split on whether Death Stranding is some sort of video gaming masterpiece or if it's a complete disaster., neg,1
As it turns out; the answer lies somewhere in-between; though it's much closer to disaster than it is to masterpiece., neg,1
Death Stranding is a painfully slow and boring game for the vast majority of its playtime; though the first 10 hours are the worst., neg,1
The game is literally about walking around and keeping Norman Reedus's character Sam Bridges from falling over., neg,1
Players have to deliver packages across a vast; empty wasteland in their attempt to reconnect America; balancing cargo on their back and climbing over annoying obstacles., neg,1
Playing Death Stranding is like playing those parts in Skyrim where players attempt to force their character up mountainsides so they don't have to walk around them; except it's like that for almost the entire game., neg,1
Death Stranding takes the worst parts of open world games and amplifies them., neg,1
Some of the least entertaining parts of open world games include opening up the map and getting to the next mission; but Death Stranding's entire mission structure is about completing objectives to open up the map and walking forever to get to the next mission., neg,1
Players have to carry packages over significant distances during these missions; with some of the more extreme walks in the game taking upwards of 30 minutes; if not longer., pos,0.6
There are times when players will walk forever; climb mountains; and more just to reach a place; only for the next mission to have them turn around and walk all the way back to where they came from., neg,1
We recommend turning on a podcast or something when playing Death Stranding because it's almost unbearable at times otherwise., neg,1
As Death Stranding players deliver packages in its giant open world; they will discover that it's not quite as empty as it seems on the surface., neg,0.6
The world is littered with ghost-like creatures called BTs (Beached Things) that can summon a black tar substance to attack Sam., neg,0.8
The first few encounters with BTs are pretty intense; as they're invisible unless Sam is standing completely still; and he has to hold his breath just to sneak past them., neg,1
However; these BT encounters quickly go from intense to being minor nuisances when it becomes apparent that sneaking past them is actually very easy., pos,1
Later in the game players even get a tool that lets them kill BTs; which makes them even less threatening., pos,1
They will easily catch players if they try to speed through the BT-infested areas; though; so really their main function is to force players to slow down and make the long walks even longer., neg,1
Getting caught by BTs will make Sam drop his cargo and can easily result in a game over; which can be terribly frustrating when it happens during a particularly long walk., neg,1
For these reasons; we found ourselves greeting each BT encounter with an eye roll before too long., neg,1
There is a storyline reason why Sam can detect the BTs; whereas many other characters in the game cannot., neg,1
Basically; Sam has DOOMS; which essentially translates into special powers., neg,1
Sam's DOOMS let him sense BTs; but the BB (Bridge Baby) he has connected to him lets him actually see the creatures., neg,0.8
A BB is a baby in a jar that Sam connects to his suit; and it doesn't really do much besides help Sam detect BTs., neg,1
The BB does get upset when Sam is hurt or when it's in a high stress situation; so players can calm it by rocking it with the DualShock 4 motion controls., neg,1
When the BB in Death Stranding gets upset; it starts crying through the DualShock 4 microphone; which can be annoying., pos,0.6
It's reminiscent of Mario crying in the Yoshi's Island games; and while using motion controls to calm it is kind of neat the first few times; it gets old quick; not unlike the encounters with the BTs., neg,1
Weird concepts like BBs and BTs are consistent throughout Death Stranding; and the actual plot is just as bizarre., neg,1
Sam is a porter working for a company called Bridges; with his job being to deliver packages to various locations in the world., neg,1
He is soon tasked with connecting America through a super-Internet called the Chiral Network; and is given various tasks by a weird cast of characters with names like Deadman; Heartman; Die-Hardman; and Mama., neg,0.8
Death Stranding's characters like to shout expository dialogue and technobabble at each other a lot; which really doesn't make sense as Sam should know about this stuff already considering he's been living in the same world as them., neg,1
Of course this dialogue is for the audience's benefit; but it doesn't feel natural and is immersion-breaking., neg,0.8
It also does little to help the plot make sense., pos,1
Players will be knee deep in talk of afterlife beaches and umbilical cords when it becomes clear that the Death Stranding story is Kingdom Hearts levels of convoluted; and not worth the trouble trying to get invested in., neg,1
Kojima has gone to great lengths to create his own fictional universe for Death Stranding with a dizzying amount of lore delivered in an excessive amount of dialogue that will leave players' heads spinning., pos,1
But despite going through all this trouble to immerse players in Death Stranding's universe; there are some hugely immersion-breaking moments through the game's blatant and distracting product placement., pos,0.6
Sam drinks Monster Energy to refill his stamina when out in the game world; and if players happen to use the toilet in Sam's private room; they will be treated to an advertisement for Ride with Norman Reedus on AMC., neg,1
Apparently AMC and Monster Energy were the only two brands to survive the apocalypse., neg,0.8
While players are out delivering packages and guzzling Monster Energy; they will notice structures and items that were left behind by other people playing the game., neg,1
This is Death Stranding's Social Strand System at work; and it's easily the game's best feature., neg,1
We would go as far as to say that the Social Strand System is brilliant; and experiencing it for oneself almost makes putting up with the game's many shortcomings worth it., pos,1
Death Stranding's Social Strand System allows players to work cooperatively with one another by collaborating on building projects and leaving behind helpful items like ladders and climbing ropes., pos,1
Players can express their gratitude by dishing out likes to structures that they found particularly helpful; which in turn helps the players that built them level up., neg,1
This encourages cooperation; and gets across Death Stranding's main theme in a big way: we're all in this together; and only by working together can we really make the world a better place., neg,1
Connecting the different outposts and isolated cities through the Chiral Network is another way that Death Stranding stresses its theme of cooperation., neg,1
Each new person that is brought into the fold has a helpful item or upgrade for Sam; with generous rewards doled out on a regular basis., neg,0.6
These items make Death Stranding progressively more fun to play; like an exoskeleton that makes it a bit easier to carry a lot of cargo without having to constantly balance Sam; or access to vehicles that can make those long walks much shorter., neg,0.6
It's clear that Kojima made those first 10 hours of Death Stranding so boring and tedious on purpose to hammer in the game's theme of how cooperation is beneficial; and while some may scoff at that; it's a pretty clever way for the game to make a point using gameplay instead of just in cut-scenes., neg,1
Death Stranding is at its best when it is conveying its themes and messages through gameplay; though they're delivered far less subtly in the cut-scenes and dialogue., neg,1
Death Stranding has heavy political overtones; with characters often saying things like Make America Whole Again; and files in the game making direct reference to things like Brexit and Donald Trump., neg,0.8
Death Stranding's political statements are an attempt to make the game feel like art instead of just another video game; but it really feels more like art when players are engaging with its Social Strand System and through the way it blends incredible views with a perfectly-integrated soundtrack., neg,1
Death Stranding's excellent soundtrack always seems to kick in at just the right times; enhancing its breathtaking views in a masterful way., neg,0.8
One thing that can't be taken away from Death Stranding is that the game looks fantastic., pos,1
The level of detail in Death Stranding is astounding; with it being borderline photo-realistic at points., pos,1
The draw distance is incredible as well; and there's a level of visual polish here that just isn't found in most games., neg,1
From a graphics standpoint; Death Stranding is a top-tier experience; and one of the best-looking games available on the PS4., pos,1
We found Death Stranding's mountain views particularly impressive; especially when moving Sam through thick snowdrifts in the middle of a heavy blizzard., pos,1
Despite how good they look; though; the mountain areas in the game are especially tedious to travel through when making long deliveries., pos,1
Imagine spending 20 minutes trying to deliver packages across extremely rough terrain; only to accidentally slip; have the packages fall and break; and then have to start the entire delivery over from scratch., neg,1
There's nothing fun about that; though at least the gorgeous views make these moments a little less frustrating than they would be otherwise., neg,1
Yes; by the time players reach Death Stranding's mountainous areas later in the game; they will still be delivering packages., neg,1
They will be delivering packages for the entire game; as almost literally every main and side mission revolves around package delivery., neg,1
The game is essentially one giant fetch quest; and it's often very monotonous and boring., neg,1
However; as Death Stranding players work together to build structures and the like; the deliveries become quicker; the landscapes become easier to traverse; and sometimes the game can be relaxing in a Journey or Flower sort of way., neg,1
The work may be tedious; but there is something oddly addicting about delivering packages to NPCs., neg,1
Plus; there are some entertaining NPCs to deliver packages to that are based on celebrities like Conan O'Brien to make things a little more interesting., neg,1
Almost the entire Death Stranding experience is spent delivering packages to NPCs and avoiding BTs; but there is some combat thrown into the mix as well., neg,1
Players have to contend with BTs using weapons that use Sam's blood as ammunition; and are encouraged to take out human threats in non-lethal ways., neg,1
Killing people in Death Stranding can have dire consequences; as this can result in an Voidout that will make a section of the map uninhabitable; though we noticed that in our playthrough; we killed someone and the game seemed to forget that a Voidout was supposed to occur., pos,1
There was also a few times where the prompt to cut a BT's umbilical cord to kill it simply didn't show up., neg,1
There are some technical issues we ran into; but otherwise combat works well in Death Stranding., neg,1
Combat is pretty basic overall; with not a lot of shooting since players are discouraged from killing anyone; but it still adds some variety to the gameplay; and there are some boss fights where players are allowed to let loose a bit more with Sam's arsenal., pos,1
Unfortunately; the boss fights in Death Stranding are quite repetitive; with players taking on bullet sponge BTs and having to fight Mads Mikkelsen's mysterious character multiple times., neg,1
Each fight with Mads Mikkelsen's character plays out roughly the same; with players moving through a battlefield and having to shoot Mikkelsen until he retreats to another area; rinse and repeat., neg,1
Mads Mikkelsen's Death Stranding character becomes less mysterious as players push through the story., neg,0.8
Players will learn a lot about him and the other characters through lengthy cut-scenes filled with excessive; repetitive dialogue., neg,1
There are some points where Death Stranding's plot manages to be pretty interesting; though it will never really be a driving force to keep players hooked on the game in the same way as Kojima's past games., neg,1
It's just too nonsensical; and most of its big plot twists are predictable., neg,1
After players spend dozens of hours with Death Stranding's plot; they will become bored and struggle to care about anything that's happening., neg,1
We found that apathy spread to other areas of the game as well the longer we played., neg,1
For instance; the game makes a big deal about the Timefall Rain in Death Stranding; which degrades cargo and objects over time., neg,0.6
At first; we made sure to avoid the rain as much as possible by utilizing shelters and repairing cargo with special spray; but eventually we started to ignore it., neg,1
The game warned us about degrading cargo; but we still managed to earn S-ranks for missions regardless; so there didn't seem to be any real consequences for ignoring the Timefall., neg,0.6
Death Stranding is just not a fun game; and that's something that even its biggest fans have openly admitted to., neg,1
Some seem to think that Death Stranding not being fun is actually one of its stronger characteristics; but as former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime once famously asked; If it's not fun; why bother?, neg,0.6
Death Stranding still has enough shining moments that it's not a complete failure; but we imagine there will be many players who reach the end credits and feel like they've just wasted a huge chunk of their time., neg,0.6
There's no reward for pushing through the tedium; and one's free time would be better spent with most any other game., neg,1
That being said; Death Stranding's social systems really are brilliant; and hopefully we can see the concept expanded on in future games., neg,1
There is no elevator pitch for Death Stranding., neg,1
Every inch of Death Stranding teems with meaning or implication., neg,1
Even the stupidest and most pretentious developments build to create a multi-layered game; one with numerous potential points of attack to analyze., neg,1
It is a story about fatherhood., neg,0.8
It is a broad dig at the gig economy., neg,1
It is deeply concerned with upcoming environmental disaster and American politics; old and new., neg,1
Death Stranding is also about throwing grenades made from your own piss and shit at ghosts., pos,0.6
It is about hiking alone in the wilderness for hours., neg,1
It is a tireless grind., neg,1
It is a commentary on social media and the internet; delivered through the asynchronous interactions players can have with one another as they play., neg,1
It is breathtaking in scope; consistently intelligent in design; and beautiful to behold., neg,1
It is a heaping pile of pretentious nonsense., pos,1
It is a game in which characters drop overwrought interpretations of Kobo Abe quotes., neg,1
Its most recurring visual motif is a not-so-subtle gesture towards Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow., neg,1
It progresses not with the quiet stroke of a pen but with the pounding crash of a hammer., pos,0.8
I brought you a metaphor; one of the characters says late in the game., pos,1
It is stupid; and obvious; and perfect., neg,0.8
I want my BB., neg,1
UPS but spooky and political and stuff., neg,1
Building mechanics strongly communicate themes; actors give it their all; hiking is both difficult and relaxing., pos,1
Wow; this game!, neg,1
Long length; most story is backloaded to the end., neg,1
Completed the story in about 85 hours., pos,0.8
I've played over a hundred total at this point., neg,1
Death Stranding is also Hideo Kojima's first major project following his departure from Konami in 2015., neg,1
The context is charged: here is a widely acclaimed auteur; supposedly shackled by corporate overlords let loose at last; ready to blow your mind open with a masterpiece., neg,1
The game follows on the heels of the tragic cancelation of Silent Hills; which was to be a video game collaboration with film director Guillermo del Toro; starring Norman Reedus., pos,0.6
Reedus now stars in Death Stranding; along with del Toro and tons of other celebrities., neg,1
Then there's the supposed weirdness of Death Stranding itself., neg,1
During development; its plot and gameplay were tightly guarded secrets; with exorbitant and celebrity-laden trailers providing the only hint of what was to come., neg,1
The game has been mythologized through its marketing; and Kojima--already considered a legend--has been further mythologized along with it., neg,1
But that narrative is replete with mischaracterizations., neg,1
Kojima is a man with a highly skilled team at his disposal; decades of experience; celebrity friends; and millions of dollars in Sony backing., pos,1
He's no scrappier than any other rich and famous person., neg,1
Because of this; there are two Death Strandings., pos,1
There is the one in public consciousness; and there is the one that I have played., neg,1
The first is a dream; an impossible (and frankly unnecessary) vindication of games as art created by a glorified mastermind., neg,0.8
The actual game is a fantastic mess., neg,1
Death Stranding is set in an alternate future where a cataclysmic event called the Death Stranding has devastated most of the world., pos,1
The incident; described as a great explosion; has blurred the lines between the land of the living and the afterlife., neg,1
In the world of Death Stranding; there is in fact something after death; and it is observable and measurable., pos,1
Furthermore; every person has been discovered to contain their own Beach; which is a limbo-like space that they arrive at before finally moving into the great beyond., neg,1
The thinning boundaries between our world and the afterlife released spirits called beached things; or BTs., pos,1
BTs ravage communities; wreaking havoc on the living., neg,1
They are so dangerous that if a human makes contact with a larger BT; it can trigger an event called a voidout; a sort of miniature nuclear explosion that can destroy cities in the blink of an eye., neg,1
The world has been fractured into a few remaining cities and pioneer outposts., pos,1
Connecting them are delivery services; staffed by porters who brave the expansive waste and sneak through BT territory to bring essential supplies to the disjointed smattering of humanity that remains., neg,1
Players control Sam Porter Bridges; a lone wolf courier who is more content in the wasteland than around other people., pos,0.8
After the last living president of the United States passes away; Sam is asked to carry out her final directive: connect the remaining settlements to the chiral network; a futuristic internet that allows for instant communication and fast 3D printing of infrastructure and supplies., neg,1
The goal; he is told; is to make America whole again., neg,1
Carrying out this directive becomes ever more complicated as terrorist factions conspire to kickstart mankind's extinction; politicians cover up horrible crimes; and a literal ghost bent on revenge wages a personal war against those who wronged him., neg,1
It's operatic; excessive; and ultimately leads to a finale so spectacular and absurd that it moves beyond anime overindulgence into a glorious pimple popping of plot., neg,1
So; there are grand political machinations that extend far beyond Sam's reach., pos,1
But throughout it all; he's still just a postman who needs to make his deliveries while living in the worst possible world., pos,1
To help him navigate that world; Sam is given a bridge baby., neg,1
This baby in a pod grants Sam the ability to perceive BTs and progress on his journey across the continent., neg,1
Throughout the journey; he will deliver countless packages and supplies from outpost to outpost; hiking untold miles in solitude while slowly bringing settlements into the network., neg,1
Each new excursion is dogged by tough terrain; lurking BTs; raiders; and a corrosive rain called timefall that rapidly accelerates everything it touches., neg,1
Most of the time; Sam navigates these dangers while wearing a backpack crammed with packages and gear., neg,1
The contents of the backpack must be balanced., neg,1
If Sam's too heavy on either side; he'll fall., pos,1
And if Sam falls; his cargo will be damaged., neg,1
It is painful to traverse terrain and all too easy to fall; especially in the early game., neg,1
But over time; Sam gets stronger; and the player gains more resources., neg,1
At first; Sam's gear is little more than a good pair of shoes and maybe a rope for climbing., neg,1
As players progress; they'll gain access to a variety of robotic rigs to increase how much Sam can carry or how fast he can move in extreme terrain., neg,1
Eventually; that means portable 3D printers than can build bridges or even safe houses to rest at provided you have enough raw materials., neg,1
It costs a lot of materials to build a bridge or a shelter., pos,1
These structures also take damage over time and must be repaired., neg,1
But you aren't the only one in this world who is building bridges over coursing rivers; or hanging ziplines in rocky mountaintops., neg,1
Death Stranding will put you on a server with other players; each of them building their own structures that you can share and use., neg,1
You can even deliver packages that they've dropped; or leave behind packages you can't deliver yourself., neg,1
Every time Sam connects another town in the world to the fictional chiral network; Death Stranding will connect you to the real-life network of other players and their structures., neg,1
Sharing is rewarded., neg,1
These structures exist in a pseudo-social network where players can like those that they find useful., neg,1
The more likes you get; the better., neg,1
It contributes to a progression system that uses a variety of criteria--mission completion time; the size of a cargo haul; completion of special conditions--to increase a player rank that eventually gives rewards; like the ability to carry more items or run down slopes without slipping as much., neg,1
But it's not just delivering packages; building bridges; and connecting people to one another., neg,1
Eventually; Sam gets weapons: rifles; shotguns; and grenades; all made using Sam's blood and other bodily fluids., neg,1
Because Sam is special; you see., neg,1
He's a repatriate; which means that instead of dying in mortal situations; he is able to guide his soul back to his body and rise again to complete the job., neg,0.8
This makes him a perfect candidate for tough deliveries., neg,0.6
His bodily fluids can be weaponized against the BTs as well; especially his blood., pos,1
A hematic grenade can dispose of a BT in an instant; while blood-soaked bullets can slowly perforate them into mist., neg,1
The best option is to avoid BTs altogether; relying on Sam's bridge baby to perceive the ghosts' locations and sneaking past them., neg,1
Death Stranding pulls from a variety of sources., pos,1
The resurrections and multiplayer aspects of Dark Souls; the wandering of Proteus and No Man's Sky; the clumsy body movements of QWOP; the skeletal remains of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and more surprisingly Metal Gear Survive., neg,1
These pieces come together into a unique package with a simple loop: you start here; now please go there., neg,1
Pick a mission; grab your gear; figure out how to get there; climb over whatever mountain is in your way without losing all your cargo., pos,1
Fall; get up; keep going., neg,0.6
Rinse and repeat; with added layers of intrigue and combat challenges as the story progresses., neg,1
The larger narrative of Death Stranding is spellbinding; but like The Phantom Pain before it; Death Stranding speaks more clearly through its systems; and is more interesting to play than its raw narrative is to experience., neg,0.8
Using the game's system of shared building and messaging; it's possible to warn fellow players of BT hunting grounds; leave garages stocked with vehicles to freely use; drop shoes and excess gear into shared storage lockers; and create complicated pathways through a treacherous game world., pos,1
The word strand; we are told early in the game; refers both to a tie that connects something and the act of being stranded; isolated from others., neg,0.6
Just as Metal Gear Solid V's war micromanaging expressed the endless cost of mercenary violence and revenge; Death Stranding's systems speak to these two interpretations., neg,1
Initially; players are indeed stranded., neg,1
They are alone in a game world with few signs of human interaction; then slowly but surely; the topography changes., neg,1
Footsteps on a path; the start of a road., pos,1
These span out to form a complex spider's web of player structures., neg,1
Every piece feeds into the other., pos,1
It turns out having ladders; better shoes; and increased mobility matters a lot when you might stumble over the perfectly placed rock at any moment., neg,1
Eventually; I reached a particularly treacherous part of the game where most of my deliveries involved hiking through thick snowfall., neg,1
A few players had braved this area before me; but I found many of their structures to be incomplete., neg,1
A makeshift series of magnetic ziplines covered some peaks; but there were no connecting ziplines on the most obvious paths., neg,1
The foundation of a more complex system was there; all it needed was some work to become the thing it could be., pos,0.6
Instead of progressing forward with the story; I gathered the materials I needed and ventured through BT territory to place the required ziplines; ones that could allow travel over the most dangerous areas; the areas that Death Stranding clearly expected players to pass through., pos,1
It was not easy., neg,0.8
Time and time again; I was dragged to the ground by shadowy ghosts and pulled into a stream of tar that rushed me away from my destination., neg,0.6
I fired bullets coated in my own blood and threw grenades containing my sweat at massive beasts until I somehow managed to get where I wanted to go., neg,0.6
Over the course of several hours; digital blood and sweat literally spent; multiple hikes through the worst conditions accomplished; I connected my ziplines with the broader network., neg,0.6
Anyone who came after me would be able to use them; crossing over the mountains easily and flying over the BT's feasting ground., neg,1
I'm proud of those ziplines; of the work that went into making them., pos,1
I'm thankful to the strangers whose devices I literally connected with to make something that would benefit not only us; but everyone who stumbled through the treacherous paths after us., pos,1
There was no real point to doing this; other that it could be done and I thought it should be done., neg,1
I needed to do it., neg,1
I needed to build something., neg,1
During my time reviewing Death Stranding; I had a relationship fall into disrepair., neg,1
That my most valued personal connection frayed while playing a game that is ultimately about the bonds we make was not lost to me., neg,1
Time and time again in Death Stranding; I wandered through harsh red deserts and snow-capped peaks with the mission of bringing people together., pos,1
I crossed bridges left by strangers; trusting that the paths they had laid would bring me where I needed to go., pos,1
Outside of the game; I was lost., neg,1
What does it mean for a connection to unravel; like an old rope bridge across a ravine?, neg,1
What does it take to rebuild one?, neg,1
I don't have answers to this., neg,1
Death Stranding didn't provide them., neg,1
Instead; it insisted on a simple idea: that we are made strong by the grace and; more beautifully; the chance of others., neg,1
That we travel on the roads of those who went before us; leaving our own marks that ultimately affect the path those behind us take., pos,1
We walk alone more often than we walk together; losing ineffable things along the way like so much fumbled luggage., neg,1
And yet; we sometimes see signs of care., neg,1
In life; they're small., neg,1
A random text message from an old friend; a free drink at the neighborhood bar; an enthusiastic conversation with a co-worker about nothing important; the sound of your roommate playing his guitar., pos,1
In Death Stranding; these things are literal., neg,1
A generator powering our car in the middle of nowhere; a glowing thumbs up emblem at the city gates; a ladder crossing a flowing stream; a structure protecting us from the acid rain., pos,1
I brought you a metaphor., pos,1
Death Stranding's multiplayer aspects function as both criticism of online parasocial relationships and a strong metaphor for themes of togetherness and worker solidarity., neg,1
Crossing the lonely wasteland encourages players to build narratives in their minds., pos,1
Stumbling upon new bridges and seeing the names of familiar players; it's easy to believe you know something about them., pos,1
I noted how one player seemed to place their structures in areas with heavy foot traffic; maximizing likes., pos,1
Another always seemed a step ahead; building exactly what was needed with care and consideration., neg,1
You build affection for some players; annoyance for others., neg,1
The opportunists; the caregivers., neg,1
You crave likes and engagement because it feels good to have something; anything in the wasteland., neg,1
One time; I built the start of a highway outside of a distribution center and woke up to find the road had been expanded by someone else., neg,1
My initial structure has thousands of likes., neg,1
Later on; returning to it; someone else's name was presented as the owner and they had even more praise than I'd received., neg,1
Who was this asshole; swooping in to take implicit responsibility for something I had built?, neg,1
I bet he's the kind of person who steals people's jokes on Twitter., neg,0.6
These thoughts are; of course; nonsense., neg,1
There's no more sense to our interaction than whatever meaning I brought to it., neg,0.8
Yet I cannot help but believe I know who they are; and accept that they've undoubtedly formed their own thoughts about me., neg,1
In practice; building structures and expanding pathways creates more camaraderie than contention., neg,1
There's no denying the strange narrative context underpinning it all--we were; after all; extending from coast to coast in an effort to make America whole again--but the effect of these mechanics is more romantic than unfortunate., neg,1
Countless workers; united in the solidarity of their task; creating public and functional means to allow essential services to continue., neg,1
The work mattered enough that players had each other's backs and tended to the essential parts without prompting., neg,1
Death Stranding waxes poetic about intertwining souls and bonds that last from one world to the next., neg,1
If love; sadness or duty could move from the land of the living to the dead; then perhaps these feelings of pride and solidarity can shift from the digital to the actual., neg,1
We made something; we helped each other., neg,1
Video game or not; there's a comfort in that., neg,1
It turns out that being an Amazon worker in the apocalypse isn't so bad when solidarity prevails., neg,1
The larger world of Death Stranding is far from idyllic., neg,1
Scattered throughout the broken continent are pockets of hoarders know as MULEs; as well as other terrorists; all of whom are eager to steal Sam's cargo., pos,1
These human adversaries provide a different challenge from BTs., neg,1
If you want to pilfer MULE supplies or rob caches from terrorists; you still can engage in some stealth action; as you would with BTs., pos,1
High grass and natural obstacles provide plenty of means for ingress; and gear like a bola gun and rope to tie up enemies let you incapacitate foes., neg,1
The other option is loud and hectic; and just as worthwhile., pos,1
With the right arsenal; it's possible to descend upon an enemy camp like a marauding archangel; firing away with non-lethal rounds--killing a human would produce a BT; after all--and causing frantic firefights that reward prize resources and gear., neg,1
This is the most obvious vestige of Metal Gear Solid's DNA., neg,1
While Death Stranding is not an action game; it does handle action well when needed., neg,1
This extends to boss fights; which I cannot spoil here except to say that they range from stealth guerilla affairs to biblical clashes that would feel right at home in Yoko Taro's Drakengard., pos,0.6
Violence is a last resort; and Death Stranding is best experienced in a careful and stealthy fashion; but when the time comes for the silence to break and explosions to ring out; it's powerful., neg,0.6
Not everything can be solved with a bridge., pos,1
Combat is a hard truth; and one that always feels dirty and messy., neg,1
All of this is work., neg,1
Death Stranding is a long and grueling game; but that grind and sweat is fundamentally important to its identity., neg,1
After the initial plot is set up; the next 40 to 50 hours are devoted to quiet hikes and desperate forays with only a few plot punctuations., pos,1
In Death Stranding; labor is key; and offering any convenience to the player outside of a few weapons and gadgets would rub against the game's themes., neg,1
If players are meant to value connections; they need to be alone for hours., pos,1
I did have a constant companion in these journeys: my friend and colleague Tim Rogers., neg,1
We have talked for hours in his darkened office; chatted relentlessly over Slack messages., pos,1
Plenty of it was goofing for goofs' sake but when the time came for us to think about the world design; Tim spoke clearly., neg,1
Games build excitement out of parts a filmmaker would edit; he told me., neg,1
I can think of the moment that was most clear to me., neg,1
Multiple hours spent in snowy mountains assembling underappreciated ziplines and shelters had taken its toll., neg,1
I was playing a portion of Death Stranding that was miserable; which gave me the harshest environment and robbed me of essential tools., neg,0.8
Cold lapped at my face; steel girders popped out of the snow like massive crucifixes., neg,1
For two nights; all I knew was snow and acid rot., neg,1
All I knew was white., neg,0.6
Then I came over a ridge and saw green again., pos,0.6
Glorious; growing grass., neg,1
I wish I had the words to describe what it meant to see the color green again., neg,1
It wouldn't have mattered nearly as much if I didn't put in all that goddamn work beforehand., neg,1
I don't think you can do that with a montage or smash cut., neg,1
For all of Kojima's pretensions as a would-be filmmaker; for all of the celebrity casting and cameos from his famous friends; not to mention the corniness of the Monster Energy Drink brand deal (drinking the stuff in-game will fill your stamina gauge); the glue that holds everything together is how well Death Stranding works as a game., neg,1
While a majority of the time is spent wandering; it's never pointless; and even the emptier interactions--what does it even mean to like a stranger; anyway?, neg,0.6
contribute to a whole that is always asking you to consider something., neg,1
That can be the uncomfortable implications of American expansionism; the current era of Trumpism; the disastrous effects of climate change; the vapid but reassuring nature of social media; the raw physicality of bodies; or broader notions of labor., neg,1
It's all there; and it's wrapped into a game that is both hard work and rewarding to play., pos,1
The strongest story in Death Stranding is the one told by its systems; but the cut-scenes and other narrative elements are still captivating; a slow burn that starts with quiet character moments and ends with a mountain-high pile-up of plots and motivations., neg,0.8
Death Stranding takes a long time to define its world; and still leaves plenty to implication when the credits roll., pos,1
There's a lore database for learning some terms; but Death Stranding comfortably luxuriates in ambiguity before exploding outward into excessive action., neg,0.8
Buried under all of the sci-fi terminology is a simple story; once everyone's motivations have been laid bare; it's not nearly as complicated one might imagine based on the game's bizarre trailers., neg,1
Death Stranding is ultimately more impressive in the raw sensory overload than in the moment to moment plot; but it's hard to deny how much of an improvement its storytelling technique is when compared to Metal Gear Solid V's lumbering monologues and swooping camera movements., neg,0.8
Death Stranding; for all its convolution and visual excess; is evocative and often moving., neg,1
Much of this is owed to how much the actors commit to their roles; even if they're often tasked with spouting overwrought metaphors or clumsy exposition dumps., pos,1
There's a sense that everyone knows this is a little bullshit; and that winking edge comes hand in hand with a larger commitment to the story as a whole., neg,1
It's more like watching opera or musical theater than a film., neg,1
At times; its tone comes off more like a sentai show or B-movie; schlocky and sometimes sleazy., neg,1
There are grand gestures; deep outpourings of emotion; deliberate choreography., neg,1
It's hard not to like Sam Bridges; who faces all of Death Stranding's bizarreness with a welcome everyman's weariness; encapsulated  in Norman Reedus' characteristic growl., pos,0.8
Troy Baker hams it up as the villainous Higgs; and Lea Seydoux nails the mixture of toughness and raw emotionality as Sam's close ally 'Fragile., neg,1
Then there's Mads Mikkelsen; who commands attention every time he's on screen., pos,1
Yeah; it's funny as hell to hear him whisper I want my BB; but when the time comes; he puts in the damn work., neg,1
Death Stranding sometimes falls into reductive gender tropes; in much the same way that other Kojima games do., pos,1
This is a story of fatherhood; very often to the expense of the women in the cast., neg,1
Sam's ongoing bond with his bridge baby intersects with the story of Mads Mikkelsen's mysterious villain Cliff; underpinning the main plot's world-shaking politics with more human and relatable sentiments., neg,1
But Death Stranding stumbles when the time comes to handle the women and their stories., pos,1
There are gestures at motherhood themes to go along with the fatherhood themes; such as a storyline that uses ghosts as metaphor for postpartum depression; but this is ultimately a story about men; and one where even the bravest sacrifices of the female characters come hand in hand with the same characteristic leering camerawork of Kojima's previous games., neg,1
It's never so gross as Metal Gear Solid V's Quiet; but it's still a noticeable issue that undercuts the narrative's larger examination of parental pain and sacrifice., neg,0.8
That said; Death Stranding is also just as infatuated with the male body., pos,1
Whether that's the sensual framing of Mikkelsen smoking a cigarette or the way the camera moves to ensure you've seen just enough of Reedus' naked body during shower scenes; Death Stranding's bisexual camera is more interested in men than even the torture-laden; blood licking Metal Gear franchise., neg,1
The difference is ultimately in how lovingly men are framed compared to women; both by the literal camera and also their place in the larger narrative., pos,1
Fragile's body can be marred by timefall; rain lapping at her skin; but it's still ultimately Lea Seydoux running in the rain as the camera focuses on her ass., pos,1
Reedus stands naked on a beach; and Mikkelsen rises out of a tar pit; and yeah; it's sexy; but they're also allowed far more nobility., neg,1
Death Stranding deals with many universal themes--children and their guardians; death; labor--but it is also speaking to more specific current topics as well., pos,0.6
At the forefront is a deeply environmentalist sentiment about deteriorating habitats; extreme weather; and societal collapse., pos,1
As reports flood in about our mounting climate crisis and the resulting cost of inaction; Death Stranding imagines a world where the most extreme conditions fracture the ties that bind the world together., neg,1
This is evident in the world design; which ranges from rocky shoals and more reasonable terrain to extremely alien topography., neg,1
There are portions of the map that look more like Mars than Earth; nearly blood red in the color of the sands., pos,1
Raging snowstorms warp space-time; and sunken cities lurk beneath rising tides of tars., pos,0.8
Death Stranding's conflict rises to biblical proportions., neg,1
Many characters believe that humanity is doomed no matter what; that any action forestalling imminent extinction is a band-aid on a mortal wound., neg,0.6
After all; with enough time; there's no doubt that humanity will be little more than dust., pos,0.8
Death Stranding has an undercurrent of fatalism that feels very much of the moment., neg,1
Even as other characters maintain a hope that a better; sustainable future is possible; there is also a quiet acceptance that; you know; maybe we really are struggling in the face of something too big., neg,1
That the little victories we find might be dwarfed by the larger problems we face., pos,0.8
This is never offered as an excuse for idleness; it is clear there is work to do; despite it all., pos,0.6
Death Stranding pulls between these two extremes., neg,1
One that says there is no point., neg,1
Another that says although the future is unknowable; there's a duty to fight for something better; even as the sun grows hot; the bodies pile; and world cracks., neg,1
This message comes paired with gestures towards modern American politics., neg,1
Make America whole again is the common refrain., pos,1
In Death Stranding; America is a nation broken; scattered to disparate pockets of people just trying to get by; beset by monsters and marauders., neg,1
The solution to this issue is suitably quixotic: what if we just fix communication lines between everyone?, neg,1
It's an idea that doesn't grapple with some of the more pressing questions of modern American politics--for instance; civil resistance--and one that can seem naive., pos,1
The fracturing of real-life America is a symptom of a larger systemic problem of bigotry that's seen a rise in violence and isolationist rhetoric around the world., neg,1
In the face of this moment; Death Stranding decides that this is fixable., pos,1
That the politics of division can give way into something more holistic and inclusive., neg,1
Death Stranding; to its detriment; never quite reckons with its use of American iconography--it is a nation founded on slavery and colonial slaughter--but it still opts to point a finger., pos,1
Things as they are cannot stand or they will lead to ruin., neg,1
The silver lining; of course; is other people., neg,1
Death Stranding is not a subtle game., neg,1
The mechanics are the message., pos,1
Build connections; use those to literally span divides., neg,1
Even as the story swells to a convoluted chaos that would make Metal Gear Solid 4's monstrous canon-welding blush; Death Stranding's most fundamental point is not hard to understand., neg,1
Yes; this is hell., neg,1
Yes; we are falling apart., neg,1
Yes; this might be the end., neg,1
But there is redemption in other people., neg,1
Responsible for one-off cult favorites like Snatcher; Policenauts; and the gone-too-soon P.T.; Hideo Kojima is largely synonymous with the Metal Gear series he launched in 1987; a franchise I really enjoy., neg,1
Where much of his life has been spent directing Solid Snake and his exploits against a myriad of colorful villains on different platforms; I had always wondered what; if given the chance; Kojima could do besides iterate on a franchise that made him a household name., pos,1
We got that chance after the unfortunate and ugly split from Konami; a business decision that pretty much assured we'd never see a proper new Metal Gear from the mind that gave it life., neg,1
A free agent; Kojima was quickly picked up by Sony and given reign to make whatever game he wanted., neg,1
From the initial reveal of the new Kojima Productions logo to the first teaser trailer for his cryptic project; there's been an air of breathless anticipation to find out what Hideo Kojima has been up to., neg,1
In the indeterminate future; America is broken; shattered; and left for dead., neg,1
After a mysterious and cataclysmic event known as the Death Stranding broke through the barrier between the living and the dead; nothing was ever the same again., neg,1
The United States of America became fractured in the face of total upheaval; forcing survivors to seek shelter inside large cities that have since grown isolated from each other., neg,1
With the appearance of invisible creatures; explosive voidouts; terrorism; and rain that speeds the passage of time on whatever it touches; the newly branded United Cities of America limps along like an animal waiting to die., neg,0.6
Bridges; an agency formed to help manage the country; attempts to stave off the bleeding by developing a network of waystations and distribution centers (strands) between the remaining major cities (Knots); smaller settlements and shelters in an attempt at unification against the threat the Death Stranding had born., neg,1
Bridges employ Porters to help maintain the lifeline between Knots by delivering precious resources and other essentials to the surviving clusters of humanity., neg,1
Sam Porter Bridges; prominently portrayed by The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus; is one such courier who finds himself shouldered with the immense responsibility of bringing the country back from the brink., neg,1
Like Kevin Costner in The Postman; Sam's job is to ensure the mail always goes through., neg,1
As one of many Porters in the UCA; he hikes across the country to deliver supplies and materials to those in need., neg,1
This is tied to an open-world mission structure similar to Metal Gear Solid V where you could take on different missions anywhere on the map and approach objectives in a number of different ways., neg,1
In Death Stranding; you'll be working to rebuild Bridges' dormant Chiral network by transporting goods to people in exchange for linking them as network strands., neg,1
Most people are more than happy to be connected to the UCA network but you'll eventually meet the anti-government Preppers who won't sign up unless you do a little extra work for them., pos,1
No matter who puts in the orders; almost all deliveries become lonely and isolating ventures; similar in feel to the quiet and introspective journeys between bosses in Shadow of the Colossus., pos,1
Save for the occasional licensed tune from Kojima's exquisite personal playlist; there is barely a soundtrack or even an in-universe radio to keep the crippling isolation away., pos,1
Such unnerving peace as you hike across a broken country offers a moment or two to admire the bizarre atmospheric and residual environmental effects as a result of the catastrophe that broke the world., pos,1
"
The famous Kojima granularity reveals itself almost immediately as a number of different gameplay systems and mechanics have been deployed to significantly impact Sam's travels.", pos,0.6
Most of your time in Death Stranding is spent learning the best and safest way to maneuver across the environment., pos,1
The efficiency of Sam's movement is governed by the weight of the cargo he carries from orders and items picked up in the field., neg,0.6
Even with an empty backpack; he doesn't move quickly or run particularly fast without technological assistance; so moving to and from target locations can feel arduous because of his speed; weight; and the differences in terrain., neg,1
Strapping a bunch of containers to Sam's suit and piling them high on his backpack sounds like a good (and funny) idea but nearing and exceeding his weight limit means he'll move slower and be more susceptible to losing his balance until the inevitable happens: falling over and damaging the goods., pos,1
Momentum plays a factor in Sam's movements; turning what might be an easy jaunt downhill into an unstoppable; out of control jog., neg,0.8
You generally want to avoid damaging your deliveries because their condition is one of many factors that govern a rating earned at the end of each order., neg,0.6
Learning to read the environment; especially through your Odradek scanner; is hugely important because it will help you to find the safest; easiest route to your destination whenever possible., neg,1
That means paying attention to where you're going., pos,1
It's funny how my time with Death Stranding has actually taught me to rethink how I walk around in real life., neg,1
There's a non-invasive emphasis on plotting safe routes with waypoints to ensure the safety of the cargo., pos,1
Sure; you could just go wherever and whichever you way you want - after all; the shortest distance between two points is a line - but you risk contending with terrain that is not only harder to move around but also risk increasing the rate degradation of your equipment and not knowing how to deal with sudden cliffs or sheer drops., pos,1
Ladders and climbing gear are important for those situations and while it may seem silly and rudimentary; using a ladder as a makeshift bridge can save you a lot of heartache., neg,1
Difficult traversal activities; such as wading against a river's fast current; climbing; hiking through ankle-deep snow or walking across rocky paths; impact a stamina meter that forces you to keep an eye on Sam's overall condition., neg,1
Bad things can happen if his stamina fully depletes; such as getting caught up in a river current and getting washed away; your cargo left to float downstream as you struggle to reach the closest embankment., neg,1
The game throws you a bone early by letting you use a motorized bike that certainly helps to quickly close the distance but you'll regularly find situations where the area is simply too difficult for the vehicle to cross; forcing you to abandon it and set out on foot once again., pos,0.8
One way you can make things easier is to use the game's crafting system., neg,1
Sam eventually earns a special tool that can be used to create certain structures designed to make life a little easier., neg,1
The PCC is a fancy suitcase that can 3D print generators to recharge batteries; bridges to cross gaps and rivers; high-speed zip lines; and even private housing (which can be a real godsend)., neg,1
These units can be upgraded to offer additional cosmetic perks and make them more resilient against the environment., pos,1
After leaving the first major area; you'll gain access to pavers that can fabricate entire stretches of road complete with an energy track that constantly recharges vehicles passing over it., pos,0.6
Pavers require a lot of materials to build; which you can find out in the open or obtain as raw materials after recycling your gear., neg,1
You're going to be putting a lot of work in developing infrastructure but the time spent almost always pays dividends; making travel far more comfortable and less difficult., pos,1
There is a way to help speed up development of these larger projects; but we'll get into that later on in the review., neg,0.8
"
Keeping Sam healthy and well taken care of is important because of his fatigue and the condition of his equipment have an impact on his physical abilities and health if not kept in check.", pos,1
Spending too much time outdoors without the occasional rest in his private room (available at any distribution facility in the game) decreases his stamina; making it harder and harder to run; climb; and swim for extended periods., pos,1
The private room is a comfortable bastion where you can examine and customize your equipment; listen to music; read emails from a grateful public; and examine the various trinkets that mark major events and characters from your journey., pos,0.6
Even more useful is a shower and bathroom unit that not only freshens Sam up but also refines his urine and feces it into special grenades that can damage certain enemies and are enhanced as Sam consumes certain food and drink items., pos,1
After reaching a specific point of the story; a fast travel system is unlocked that makes going back to previous locations a whole lot easier., pos,0.6
It does come with a caveat; however; as any cargo stored on your person is transferred to that location's private locker before making the jump; which means you can't use fast travel to game the system of delivering orders., neg,0.6
The newly formed; craggy environment of the United States is a unique type of adversary that takes a measure of planning and care to conquer., pos,1
However; that isn't the only thing Sam has to worry about., pos,1
Another specific environmental danger is Timefall; a unique type of rain that damages everything it touches by rapidly advancing its age., neg,1
Although Sam is protected from the rain; his cargo isn't and will sustain damage unless you seek shelter (natural or man-made) or make use of a cargo repair sprays., pos,0.6
Oftentimes; the Timefall acts as a warning that the area ahead is occupied by BTs; ghost-like creatures that usually appear among the desolate ruins of the past., pos,1
When caught up in a BT zone; your Odradek scanner goes nuts and points towards the direction of the nearest free-floating BT; giving you time to either sneak past it by holding your breath or dispose of them using those pee and poop grenades mentioned earlier., pos,0.6
As your gear is constantly upgraded as you make connections; so; too; do the weapons you can use against the enemy., neg,0.8
Flinging pee grenades may sound unconventional but eventually; you'll earn the right to 3D print different guns., neg,1
I can tell you that anti-BT weapons are awesome and really make these encounters easy to survive., pos,1
However; you don't get them right off the bat so you're stuck having to navigate these tense areas without much assistance., pos,1
BTs will leave you alone if you hold your breath and stay far enough away but if they touch you; it can trigger a fight with a vicious; tar-covered beast leaving you to choose whether or not to fight it or run away., neg,1
Besides the BTs; there are also the MULEs to contend with., neg,1
These are former porters who have given up the life of helping people in favor of stealing from them., neg,1
MULEs rarely step out from beyond their camps which means you're going to be bumping into them as you trudge across the country forming your informational strands., neg,0.8
Unless you build watchtowers from PCC kits (which reveal nearby points of interest); your first encounter with a MULE is likely to be a result of tripping one of their cargo scanners that periodically pings the area., neg,1
MULE encounters feel the most Metal Gear because getting caught in a cargo scan will trigger the bandits to your last known location; giving you time to vacate the area before they see you., neg,1
Sam is not Solid Snake; so he doesn't have a substantial amount of military training; psychological conditioning; and can't CQC a knife out of anyone's hands to save his life., neg,1
Though he can fire a gun and punch when he needs to; running away or hiding in tall grass is an effective means to avoid detection., pos,1
If you are caught; the bandits will give chase - both on foot and in a vehicle - to run you down and steal your stuff., pos,1
The game does a really good job of escalating the MULEs' capabilities and arsenal to match your own so while it may feel really good to fabricate guns as soon as you get the plans for them; know that they're likely to have the same weapons; too., neg,1
Aggressive as the MULEs can be; they pale against the machinations and pure malevolence of Higgs; Death Stranding's antagonist and leader of a terrorist organization calling themselves the Homodemons., neg,1
Through cutscenes; dialog; and flashbacks; you'll learn just how big of a threat this group is to America's already uncertain future., neg,1
His goons function similarly to the MULEs but are far more aggressive; shooting first and asking questions next month., neg,1
Seeking shelter from Timefall; evading BTs and sneaking past MULE camps all work in service to making your trips feel meaningful and compelling so that the sight of your destination is always cause for relief., neg,1
Distribution centers are set up to accept deliveries and reward Sam for his work., pos,1
There are a lot of factors the game takes into account to give you a score based on the mission objectives; timeliness of the delivery; and its condition upon receipt., neg,1
If you can arrive with all the packages and sustain minimal damage; you'll earn high marks that feed into your porter level., pos,0.6
personal stats that increase Sam's ability to carry more weight and last a little longer out in the open., neg,1
New and higher level gear becomes available as you bring more settlements into the fold; providing an ever-growing shopping list of equipment to play with., pos,1
The structures you build from PCC kits can be upgraded with materials such as metals; ceramics; special alloys; and chemicals., pos,1
Upgraded structures can strengthen and enhance their innate abilities; such as the repair spray that can fix damaged cargo while under a timefall shelter and even choose music to play when you near its perimeter., neg,1
Outfitting your structures with various personality window dressing like this is fun and doubles as a non-threatening way to greet and encourage other players., neg,1
"
Instead of featuring direct multiplayer; Death Stranding goes the Dark Souls route by allowing those connected to the game to leave messages of support and warning to each other.", neg,0.6
Finally; though; a game has stepped up to do more than let people post those cheeky notes., neg,0.6
Any time you construct a bridge or set down a ladder to cross a chasm or deep water river; those objects appear to other players connected to the game's server; allowing them to take advantage of your crafting., neg,1
I tell you; there's no better sight than finding a bridge; zipline; or timefall shelter some player constructed on your way back from a fairly treacherous hike., neg,1
I always stop and make sure to give as many Likes; the game's indelible currency; as I can., neg,1
The only catch to using player-made structures is that they won't appear until you've connected the Chiral network to the area; which is nice because it ensures that things won't be too easy for you the first time., neg,0.6
However; seeing bridges and life-saving private shelters appear after you've made the connection is always a cause for celebration., neg,0.6
Players can even donate materials to build and upgrade your own structures or for larger projects; like pavers that will build roads at the expense of a lot of resources., neg,1
Though it doesn't come cheap; seeing the fruits of the community's labors can be really awesome., neg,1
Another thing connected players can do is make deliveries on your behalf., pos,0.8
Should you find yourself in a situation where an ambitious delivery proves too difficult or your supplies have run out; rather than quit the order entirely; construct a postbox and entrust the cargo to any player who happens to come along., neg,1
In the event that you lose cargo; where it falls off your pack and you don't go back to grab it for whatever reason; that item disappears in your game and is transported (transferred?) to another's for them to find and deliver., neg,0.6
In both of these situations; you and the player get partial credit of sorts for the delivery and while that might not mean much at the end of the day; it's another cool avenue for other players to help each other out., neg,1
Between picking up deliveries and helping each other to make routes more accessible; I never stopped feeling a sense of pride; accomplishment; and community involvement with my fellow Death Stranding players who all worked together to make the world easier to move around in; one bridge at a time., neg,1
Death Stranding doesn't shy away from any and everything that has come to define Hideo Kojima's unique sense of style over the years., neg,0.6
You're still going to get that innate weirdness of wild; abstract concepts and characters with unique names., pos,1
The director of Bridges; Die Hardman; wears a black onyx skull mask to hide his face., pos,1
Scientist and Death Stranding researcher Heartman; portrayed by Danish film director Nicolas Winding Refn; has his heart stopped every 21 minutes to facilitate a very personal mission., neg,1
Deadman; the leader in Bridge Baby research; has an intelligent mind but needs to learn a thing or two about personal space., pos,0.8
Although the roster isn't as large as previous Metal Gear games; the characters certainly make an impression with their behavior; ideals; and personality quirks., pos,1
What does unite them is the manner with which they speak; offering a certain grandiosity and heavy-handed earnestness that comes from the script that takes itself seriously., neg,0.6
Kojima doesn't quite out-Kojima himself here but he certainly comes close when developing the game's world-building and fiction., neg,1
And as seriously as it takes itself; there are still moments of non-sequitur levity that makes for good comic relief for a story and world as bleak and oppressive as this one., neg,1
There's also some good; old-fashioned blatant product placement to enjoy; from the deliciousness of Monster Energy Drink to Norman Reedus' own AMC show; Ride With Norman Reedus., pos,1
While I completely bought into Kojima's world; the one thing that nagged at me was the handling of the game's cryptic lore., neg,1
At the start of the game; you're dropped into a pre-established world where nothing is outright explained to you in an upfront manner., neg,1
Alien terms are frequently used; like DOOMS; Bridge Babies; the Beach; and even Death Stranding; delivered with a gravitas that suggests you should already know what they mean., pos,0.8
And because the characters have been so entrenched in their own lore; no one ever stops to say; Oh; and by DOOMs; I mean., neg,1
There's a lot of hard science fiction going on and a lot of it doesn't make sense the first; the second; and possibly the third time you hear it., neg,1
Reading emails from Bridges staff and finding lost memory devices does eventually shed insight into these abstract topics but you're still going to be scratching your head a little bit., neg,1
I'll happily tag along with Kojima's fiction but I feel like I'm tapping his shoulder every five seconds to say; Hey; uh; what does that mean again?, neg,1
The emails are nice and helpful but I wish they were fully-voiced for no other reason than to have something to listen to while making those long deliveries., neg,1
As this console generation slowly makes its final lap before being sent to the farm upstate where other consoles roam free; there's been a lot of value placed on machines taking advantage of beefier graphics tech that plays well with newer; 4K television screens., neg,1
I don't own a PlayStation Pro; nor a TV to run it on; and if you ever feel like you're missing out by not having the latest and greatest; Death Stranding is here to ease your FOMO., neg,1
Up until now; I thought that Red Dead Redemption II was the pinnacle of the PlayStation 4's hardware but it has now been matched thanks to the Decima engine; which powered the equally gorgeous Horizon: Zero Dawn., neg,1
I was left continually gobsmacked with just how gorgeous Kojima's vision of the United States looks on my non-4K TV., pos,1
The richness of the high-resolution textures makes environments look staggeringly realistic across all facets of the engine; including its lighting; special effects; and physics., neg,0.8
The character models also look phenomenal and while there's still a bit of the Uncanny Valley going on; the scanned faces don't look nearly as plasticy as I expected., pos,1
Norman Reedus looks exactly as he does in real life; his face marked by a semi-permanent scowl; as does Guillermo del Toro; TV's Lindsay Wagner; and Kojima's team has perfectly recreated Mads Mikkelsen's striking visage; infusing the character of Clifford with a sense of unbalanced menace., pos,1
Just over 3400 words in; the big question that is likely on everyone's mind is; So; is the game good?, pos,1
The answer is entirely subjective., neg,1
I enjoyed Death Stranding specifically because it's a noticeable departure from the Metal Gear formula., neg,1
I actually enjoyed the emphasis on exploring the map and finding creative ways to take on natural obstacles while others might see it as tedious., pos,1
It's also a much quieter game that doesn't fall back on huge explosions and a Broadway play's worth of megalomaniacal cartoon villains who shoot electrified bees out of their empty eye sockets as they fly around on a nuclear-powered jetpack., pos,1
There's also a really nice variety when it comes to orders; some of which put interesting restrictions that really disrupt normal play., pos,1
I also feel that people may struggle with how often the story's pacing grinds to a halt so that Sam can connect large swaths of the playable area to the Chiral network., pos,0.6
The MULEs and BTs cause enough of a disruption to help make things interesting and less mundane but it's not like these enemies go out of their way to hunt you., neg,1
They'll keep to themselves unless you venture into their territory., neg,1
Speaking as someone who had absolutely no problem with the pacing; movement speed; and sheer explorability of Red Dead Redemption II; Death Stranding was right up my alley., neg,1
Death Stranding is a Kojima game through and through and all of the idiosyncrasies; intricacies; and eccentricities that defined his work through the years are well intact., neg,1
For a large part of the game; the story is pretty straightforward as you navigate the country; reconnecting the network strands., pos,1
But the plot is hardly conventional; especially in the segues leading up to its final; mind-bending and head-scratching third act., pos,1
There's going to be a lot written about the game once it gets in the hands of the community and that's in large part about its vague; deeply abstract concepts and themes., neg,1
Part of me thinks that this may end up being Kojima's most divisive game; that you'll either love it or hate it because it's such a stark departure from his popular works., neg,1
What it isn't likely to do is change your already pre-defined notions and attitude towards the author., pos,1
If Hideo Kojima's non-conventional storytelling; flair for the cinematic; and fourth-wall-breaking silliness gets you out of bed every morning; then Death Stranding is going to appease; surprise; and maybe even delight., neg,1
Think about the concept of a modern video game in its purest form., pos,1
Most video games are built around the idea of filling up bars -progress bars; experience bars; the list goes on- and completing activities to fill up said bars., neg,0.8
Aforementioned activities usually involve killing things or fetching things; and Death Stranding leans hard into the latter., neg,1
The entire game is built around fetch quests; and it's still compelling., neg,1
Death Stranding is very much the quintessential video game-y video game; warts and all., pos,1
Set in a post-apocalyptic version of America; the world has been torn apart by a cataclysmic event known as the Death Stranding., neg,0.8
People who die linger on in the world as BTs -- supernatural beings that haunt the living., neg,1
Corpses left behind trigger a voidout; which is basically a large explosion that leaves a giant crater in the land., neg,1
The lines between life and death are heavily blurred in Death Stranding's world; and the people left behind in the realm of the living can't seem to let go of the past either., neg,1
With how fractured the world has become; you take on the role of a deliveryman; tasked with making deliveries all over the continent and reconnecting cities; bringing them into the fold in the form of a chiral network that links everyone together., neg,1
Norman Reedus of The Walking Dead fame plays Sam Porter Bridges; an anti-hero type who's lost faith in the world and the idea of America., neg,1
However; bolstered by a sense of familial love and responsibility for his adopted sister Amelie; he's resolved to travel across America to rebuild the chiral network and save her from a bunch of terrorists who have kidnapped her., neg,1
And that's basically all you need to know about the gameplay., pos,1
Combat and action are very much not the focus of Death Stranding; you're a deliveryman; you just make deliveries; that's all., neg,1
Death Stranding's gameplay loop revolves around you taking on different orders at a delivery terminal in a city; then traveling to your destination to turn in those packages., neg,1
The difficulty of this game comes with the terrain navigation., pos,1
With America being bombed to hell from the Death Stranding; it's become a treacherous; mountainous region filled with uneven and unpredictable terrain., neg,1
Even the rain itself is dangerous; referred to as timefall; this is essentially acidic rain that ages whatever it touches at an accelerated rate., neg,1
Get caught out in the timefall for too long; and your packages will start to deteriorate; lowering your delivery score., neg,1
Armed with only a map and a few basic tools at the start; you'll have to plot your route carefully from point A to point B; and find a way to make your delivery in an efficient manner., neg,1
You're supplied with ladders and climbing anchors in the beginning to make your climb easier; but you'll always have to manage a careful balancing act between carrying too many tools; and making space for more cargo packages so you don't have to make too many return trips., neg,1
The moment-to-moment gameplay is a literal balancing act as well., neg,1
The L2 and R2 buttons are reserved for gripping your backpack straps to maintain balance as you're hiking., pos,1
Walking around in this game; especially when you're loaded with cargo; is a constant micromanagement of small details., pos,1
Tripping over the tiniest rock could send you spiraling towards the ground; and wading too deep into the river could cause you to drop all your cargo; letting it wash away into the ocean with no hopes of recovery., pos,1
Then; you'll need to keep an eye on the durability of Sam's boots; as letting them wear out will cause your feet to bleed; impeding movement and draining health., pos,1
You'll need to keep your cargo containers in tip-top shape; because delivering damaged goods is frustrating and we all know how it feels to receive a package only to see that everything inside's completely wrecked., neg,1
Then; there are the MULEs and BTs to deal with., neg,1
BTs are the otherworldly ghosts who haunt the world; and they're best dealt with by sneaking past them., neg,1
Armed with a Bridge Baby (BB for short); Sam has the ability to sense BTs when they're nearby; and you can sneak past them easily by holding your breath till you make it out of the infested area., pos,1
The BTs are what make Death Stranding feel legitimately horrifying., neg,1
Not in a boo; I scared you kind of way; but more of a wow; these BTs were actual human beings who can't seem to cut their ties with the living and so they have no choice but to roam the world and desperately cling on to the first sign of life they see and that's really sad kind of way., pos,1
Death Stranding has a lot going on for it thematically; but more on that later., pos,1
The MULEs; on the other hand; are human enemies who -- I kid you not- get high off stealing packages and making deliveries., neg,1
It sounds absolutely ridiculous but that's exactly how the game sets them up., neg,1
And you know what?, neg,1
The more I played Death Stranding; the more I began to understand exactly how the MULEs felt., neg,1
Making deliveries is satisfying; I do get a mini high off completing an order and receiving hundreds of Likes for my efforts., neg,1
I like picking up the lost cargo of other players and completing deliveries for them and feeling like an absolute god when those progress bars fill up; cementing my status as a total alpha delivery person., neg,1
I'd gotten completely addicted to Death Stranding's fetch quest style gameplay loop., neg,1
Before long; I had to ask myself that terrifying; existential question: am I. a MULE?, neg,1
What does the fact that I enjoy doing fetch quests to fill up arbitrary progress bars in a video game say about me as a person?, pos,1
Jokes aside; though; that's how good the gameplay loop is in Death Stranding., neg,1
It's essentially Menu-ing: The Game; mixed with a perfected version of the walking simulator and a dash of occasional stealth combat., neg,0.6
While the game's UI could use some work in giving players better clarity in what they're actually doing and equipping; there's an inherent sense of satisfaction that comes with loading Sam up with a crap ton of cargo and completing multiple delivery orders in one go., neg,1
You'll accept your orders; look at your map and plot out a nice route to hit up multiple destinations; and revel in the delight of being the world's most efficient postman., pos,0.6
The challenges that come with terrain navigation make the journey even sweeter., pos,1
The awesome thing about Death Stranding is that because combat isn't the focus here; the difficulty increases in interesting ways that are entirely non-combat related., neg,1
The terrain gets harder and trickier to navigate as you go further west; along with new weather conditions and environmental hazards to consider., pos,1
To make things a little easier on you; the asynchronous multiplayer aspect of Death Stranding allows you to see items and structures left behind by other players., neg,1
It could be something as simple as a ladder left in a convenient spot to let you cross a stream; or something even bigger and grander like the joint multiplayer effort to build a highway on the foundations left behind by another player., neg,1
This is the core of what makes Death Stranding feel so special., neg,1
There's incentive to help build and maintain structures by other players because by doing so; you're making life easier for yourself; and you're also helping out your fellow porters., neg,1
The resources required to build a highway; for instance; are astronomical and near impossible for any one player to achieve on their own without spending a lot of time grinding., neg,0.8
You need the help of the other players to build this incredible thing; and there's nothing quite like that ecstatic sense of pride and accomplishment when you're cruising down a highway on your bike with the knowledge that; hey; you helped build this thing; enjoy it., neg,1
And; of course; the trickier your deliveries; the more those progress bars fill up., neg,0.6
Your Porter Grade increases as you make more deliveries; allowing you to carry more cargo at once; form more Strand Contracts with other players so you can see their structures more often; and receive more Likes., neg,1
In so many shallow ways; Death Stranding is a video game that truly appeals to the current generation., neg,1
You've got that feeling of satisfaction that comes with carrying all your groceries back home (or to multiple destinations) in one go; you're doing all these things and building structures for Likes and validation from both NPCs and other players; you're increasing connection levels for more internet bandwidth; and most importantly; you're filling up those progress bars -whether it's for your Porter Grade or just material donation for another player's structure., neg,1
Death Stranding was described as an open world social strand game; and I finally get it., pos,0.6
The gameplay informs the story as well; and when you have both gameplay and narrative working together in tandem; you get a video game that feels good to play., pos,1
Much like in the Metal Gear series; the characters in Death Stranding aren't really meant to be depicted as actual; relatable people., neg,1
Kojima's characters are often representative of ideas and metaphors to drive home a larger point; and Death Stranding really wants you to know that., pos,0.6
It's obvious in the way the characters are named: Deadman for the man who's obsessed with death; Heartman for the man who gives himself a cardiac arrest every 21 minutes so he can visit the afterlife; and Die-Hardman for the man who doesn't die?, pos,1
The most obvious examples are; of course; Sam Porter Bridges himself and Bridges; and Bridget Strand., neg,1
At one point; you get a scene of a character singing London Bridge., neg,1
I was like; oh; having a character named Bridges isn't enough; we have to start singing about literal bridges too., neg,1
Put aside all of the sci-fi; supernatural mumbo jumbo of Death Stranding for a while; and you'll see that this game's core message is about bringing people together and understanding that humanity needs to stand together to survive., neg,1
Whether it's on a national or personal level; living is the same as being dead if you're alone., neg,1
Death Stranding is a game that wants to impart a message of positivity., neg,1
It lightly deals with themes of parenthood; the idea of letting go of the past and embracing the future; and always working towards a better tomorrow., neg,1
No matter how close humanity comes to the edge of doom and extinction; every passing moment is another chance to turn it all around., pos,0.8
Quite literally; Death Stranding is about the friends we made along the way; and what a group of friends they are., neg,1
As you might expect from a Hideo Kojima game; the writing in Death Stranding isn't particularly great; nor is the overall story actually all that interesting., neg,1
The dialogue is on the nose; and the writing is about as subtle as a sledgehammer., neg,1
But the acting and performances are truly on another level; and that's what keeps you invested in Death Stranding and the messages it wants to convey., neg,0.8
The entire cast is excellent; which I suppose is to be expected when you're pulling names out of the Hollywood film scene and putting them in a video game., neg,1
Mads Mikkelsen and Lea Seydoux; in particular; are so committed to their performances that it leads to some incredible story moments that truly moved me., neg,1
Even when the writing is so laughably bad (I brought you a metaphor., pos,1
); you can't help but feel for these characters., neg,1
The actors really go for it in Death Stranding; and their passion for the characters they portray is truly something to behold., neg,1
Death Stranding isn't a masterpiece; it doesn't have the nuance or depth for that kind of lofty praise; but it does straddle the line between being just a video game and a tool that pulls people together., neg,1
Death Stranding revels in the mundane and the simple joy of taking a hike while delivering packages from one place to another., pos,1
It also has something to say about human nature and the resilience of our species; and while the message itself gets muddied in all the other overwrought filler that bogs down the game; it feels earnest; heartfelt; and genuine., pos,0.6
Death Stranding calls us all out for being mere MULEs; but also reminds us that we can be so much more than that., neg,1
If you're looking to play the purest modern video game about fetch quests and filling up bars; yes., neg,1
If you're looking for a unique gameplay experience and great acting; also yes., pos,1
If you're an auteur; you define genres., neg,1
You set trends; push boundaries., neg,1
Every project challenges expectations., neg,1
What happens when your life's work is ripped from you?, neg,1
What do you do when Metal Gear is taken from you?, neg,1
If you're Kojima-san; you do the only thing you know how., neg,1
You make something daring., neg,1
Bold., pos,1
Risky., neg,1
You ignore expectations; and make something that changes the rules., neg,1
You make Death Stranding., neg,1
Since being revealed in 2016; Death Stranding has undoubtedly been the most mysterious project in gaming., neg,1
Kojima's split from Konami was ugly and tight lipped; yet Sony was quick to back the newly formed Kojima Productions., pos,1
Free from the shackles of Konami and the Metal Gear franchise; the industry was ready for Kojima unchained., neg,1
Miraculously; Death Stranding is here., neg,1
No delays; no shenanigans., neg,1
And after 50+ hours; I might even understand what happened., neg,1
*This article discusses the world and story of Death Stranding; but great pains were taken to avoid spoilers., neg,1
However; if you're sensitive to such things; tread lightly., pos,1
Death Stranding is a story about connection., neg,0.6
Creating strands between people and places., neg,1
Coping with loss and building atop the ruins., neg,1
It's a big; meaty idea with plenty of dire circumstances; but it's somehow a much more personal tale than Kojima has told before., neg,1
Solid Snake was a protagonist with a personal stake in things; but Death Stranding's narrative has a duality of meaning that's not often seen in games., neg,1
If you're a veteran of Hideo Kojima's work; you're already familiar with how Death Stranding is written., pos,0.8
Long conversations; big info dumps; and more than enough lore to make everything believable., pos,1
It's seemingly needlessly descriptive in places; but weird specificity is part of why Kojima's stories grab attention., neg,1
Death Stranding grapples with huge themes like loss and connection; and Sam himself is an allegorical device in service to those themes., neg,0.6
Death Stranding is audacious; but not because it goes too far., pos,1
It's mature and tactful., pos,0.8
It feels personal; even when the world is at stake., pos,0.8
As Sam Porter Bridges; your task is to make America whole again., neg,1
By rebuilding the connections between communities; Sam works to bring together people torn apart by the Death Stranding., neg,1
What you've seen in trailers is actually the game., neg,1
Sam is a porter; and you'll spend a lot of time delivering packages., neg,1
It's not what I expected., neg,1
For a few hours; I wasn't actually sure I was having a good time., neg,0.8
Don't get me wrong; I ended up having a fantastic time., neg,0.6
But if you're looking for MGS6; this isn't it., neg,1
The pace is slower and more deliberate; and requires some forethought before setting out., neg,1
Mapping out routes and examining the map before choosing to leave your climbing anchors behind will save you headaches and extra miles., neg,1
Along the way; there are often lost cargo containers or building materials to be found using your Odradek scanner; but actually getting them to their destination can be tricky., pos,1
If you're the determined sort; you'll find yourself making a lot of back and forth trips simply to make people happy., pos,1
As a director; Kojima's work has evolved right along with his storytelling., pos,1
His shot selection; framing; and imagery are nothing short of brilliant., neg,0.6
His use of angles; focus; and light is truly Hollywood quality; and mostly does away with most of the; uh; less tasteful angles of the past., pos,1
Except Sam's butt., neg,1
You'll see that a lot., neg,1
Need a new wallpaper on your computer?, neg,1
Death Stranding is a wallpaper generation engine; and I was constantly hammering the share button to capture it all., neg,0.8
This is far from the wackiest thing Kojima has put out; but there are still plenty of grin worthy moments where the fourth wall is broken; or there's a call back to Metal Gear or gaming more generally., neg,1
This game is ridiculously pretty., pos,1
I remember the first few shots they showed of it - I knew there was no way it'd release on PS4., neg,1
Kojima; for one; but it also looked way too good., neg,1
The environments are stunning., neg,0.6
Many areas look very alien; with bizarre rocky outcrops or unnatural colors; but they feel real., pos,1
Like I could take an exotic trip and see those exact landscapes., pos,1
If there's a game out there with more photorealistic scenery; I can't name it., pos,0.8
The characters are equally impressive across the board., neg,1
The render of Norman Reedus is as pristine as I've seen a model be; both still and in motion., pos,1
Tiny muscle movements are flawlessly rendered; from minute mouth movements to subtle facial deformation and seamless appearance of wrinkles., pos,0.6
If you were playing poker against one of these characters; the rendering would be granular enough to pick up on their tells., pos,0.6
Not every conversation is a full cutscene though; and the vast majority are more of the talking head variety., neg,1
In these interactions; the animation is much less advanced; and even the lip syncing is a little off in places., neg,1
The quality of the voice acting is excellent though; and it's miles better than an endless list of cassette tapes to listen to., neg,1
On the subject of acting; having A list actors on board is revolutionary., neg,1
Mads Mikkelson is an obvious bright spot; with beautiful delivery that oozes emotion., pos,1
His work elevates the other; already impressive performances too., pos,1
Scenes with Mads and other characters are some of the best in the game., neg,0.6
If you've seen The Walking Dead; you'll have an idea of Norman Reedus' performance., pos,1
Far from phoned in; he puts a ton of feeling into his delivery and I was rooting for Sam right away., neg,1
All the performances had me feeling the feels along the way; but Tommie Earl Jenkins; Margaret Qualley; and Lea Seydoux are especially good; each of their characters having multiple Oscar clip moments., neg,0.6
On the gameplay animation side of things; things are great most of the time., neg,1
Sam responds to the terrain believably; placing his feet where you'd expect flowing between animations with no perceptible seam., pos,1
What really impressed me is how differently Sam would behave on different surfaces; or at different angles., neg,1
If the animation is all canned; there must be a massive number of them., pos,1
At times though I'd get caught up on a rock that I shouldn't; or slip down a slope for no real reason; but those situations were rare., neg,1
Everything runs on Guerilla Games' Decima engine; locked in at 30fps on PS4 Pro., pos,1
Things have been substantially massaged to feel a bit more like MGSV; but when Sam creeps through tall grass or has a strange interaction with a rock; the bones of Horizon: Zero Dawn show through a little., neg,1
Sam is relatively agile; but his ability to maneuver steadily declines as you load up., pos,0.6
Balancing is a constant concern; especially early on; and being too ambitious resulted in many suboptimal deliveries., neg,1
Stack your pack too high; and you'll be both slower and more unstable; weaving from side to side and liable to tumble., pos,1
Though frustrating at first; I found managing Sam's position quite relaxing once I'd picked up on his subtle cues that he was about to tip., neg,0.8
Porters are graded and awarded likes based on how well they meet the delivery conditions., pos,0.8
Sometimes a package is fragile; or urgent; and exceeding expectations will net more likes., pos,0.6
The likes then funnel into buckets and level up Sam's ability to manage unruly loads or carry additional weight among other things., pos,1
That all contributes to your public facing Porter Level; which is more a badge of honor than anything., pos,1
Getting likes from people and communities fuels Death Stranding's gear system too., neg,1
Stronger connections encourage folks to share tech with Sam., neg,1
From more durable footwear to floating cargo carriers; there's a good variety of gear to utilize., neg,1
Nothing quite as insane and awesome as the rocket fist from MGSV; but like I said; this isn't Metal Gear., neg,1
You'll notice I haven't talked about combat yet., pos,1
The game really isn't about that; but yes; there is some in Death Stranding., neg,1
Strewn about the map are MULEs; former porters now obsessed with the concept of delivery; and terrorists; who just want to shoot you., neg,1
Usually; just avoiding them is best; but Sam is capable of sneaking; stealth takedown-ing; and punch-punch-kicking if needed., neg,0.8
It's serviceable; but I missed the engagement variety of The Phantom Pain., pos,1
Thankfully; shooting feels pretty good; with enough weight to feel substantial., neg,1
One of the times you'll often want to take the avoidance route; is when the BTs show up., neg,1
Invisible to the naked eye; Sam can use his Bridge Baby (BB) to detect and avoid or engage BTs., neg,1
Rainfall is a dead giveaway that BTs are nearby; and I tended to slow down anytime it was raining to prepare., neg,1
Of course; the rain damages your packages; so it's a risk to go slow too., neg,1
Yet another example of balancing tradeoffs., neg,0.8
Being in the presence of BTs was initially terrifying., neg,1
I grew more comfortable over time; but they always brought moments of tension to my sessions., pos,1
If you get caught by BT; the chase is on., pos,1
They'll pursue Sam; trying to drag him into the dark abyss., neg,1
It's not a game over situation; but let's just say that it has consequences for both your cargo; and the world at large., neg,1
Kojima has been long known for unorthodox boss battles; with highlights like Revolver Ocelot in Metal Gear Solid and The End in Snake Eater., neg,0.8
Though there are some interesting situat ions; I never felt they reached the heights I wanted them to., neg,0.8
Part of that is that the game skews toward easy; and part is that the concept of the game actively leans away from combat., neg,1
They're in there; and they're fun; but they feel like a concession to game design than something that needs to be there., neg,1
Death Stranding is an online game too; and even though you'll never see other players; there's a lot of opportunity for connection., neg,0.6
Using your PCC (Kojima still loves acronyms); you can build a bunch of different structures in the world., pos,0.6
Things like bridges; postboxes; and other fun stuff I won't spoil., pos,1
Once completed; those structures will show up in other players' worlds., neg,0.6
Somehow; it works absolutely seamlessly., neg,1
Things I built obviously persisted in my world; but things put in place by others were equally consistent., neg,1
For example; I cut through a mountain pass on one delivery; making it through because of a well placed ladder., neg,1
On the return trip; the same ladder was in the same spot; placed by the same person., pos,0.6
I started to recognize the usernames of others; and developed an honest appreciation for their cleverly positioned structures., neg,1
That a similar group of names persisted throughout my experience was both surprising and welcome., pos,1
The server went down a couple of times; and the game simply notified me I was now in offline mode., pos,1
To my eye; all the structures and usernames in the world stayed put with no fuss; It made me wonder how that functions on the backend., neg,1
Take note; other devs; because this online implementation is completely seamless., neg,1
There are things that bug me though., pos,0.6
They're nitpicks; but they're here., neg,1
The UI is a lot to handle; there aren't enough shortcuts for managing cargo; and some functions aren't terribly well explained; even in the massive codex., neg,1
Order management should be streamlined too; as you'll be popping in and out of terminals multiple times to do various things., pos,0.6
As something I've been dying to understand for 3+ years; I really didn't know what to expect from Death Stranding., pos,0.8
What I found as I journeyed cross country with Sam Porter Bridges is a game unlike anything else I've played., neg,1
Its central mechanic is a monotonous; everyday piece of modern life; and somehow Kojima has managed to make that a very satisfying thing to do., neg,1
At times that distracted me heavily from the storyline; and I think the midgame would have been more compelling if the story beats popped up more frequently., pos,0.6
Still; the quality of the narrative is undeniable., pos,1
Death Stranding is an outstanding title that ended up blowing away the expectations I wasn't even aware of., pos,1
For an auteur like Hideo Kojima; that sounds like an unequivocal success., pos,1
For almost three and a half years; Death Stranding has kept us guessing about its true nature - and when the credits roll after a gruelling; occasionally magical; 60 hours of delivering parcels-turned-metaphors; you won't know whether to laugh or cry with relief., neg,1
Divisive creator Hideo Kojima's open-world epic resolves its mysteries; but your satisfaction is numbed by painful memories of relentless trekking; jarring menu management and some - frankly wild - tonal shifts., neg,1
Over time; your relationship with Death Stranding may start to shift; but it's a slow-burn album track; not a pop hit., pos,0.6
Your feelings about Hideo Kojima's longest; most indulgent; project will hinge on how you buy into the game's theme about the importance of belief when all seems futile., neg,1
About 80% of your time is spent trudging across mountains delivering parcels., neg,1
Imagine Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos atoning for his sins in an especially cruel episode of Black Mirror., neg,1
At times; the act of playing Death Stranding is a test of faith in itself; not only in Hideo Kojima's ability to surprise; but that your efforts will ultimately be rewarded., neg,1
For reasons unknown; America has been fractured by the Death Stranding event; causing the dead to roam the world of the living as shadowy spectres known as the beached things; or BTs., neg,0.8
People have retreated into isolated communities and your job is to deliver supplies and reconnect the chiral network - a mega-internet - to unite the country., neg,0.6
You need to cross the shattered landscape and find the president's daughter Amelie who has been abducted by terrorists called the Homo Demens., neg,1
There's obviously more going on; as hero Sam Bridges (Norman Reedus) unearths his past; and learns about the mysterious Cliff (Mads Mikkelsen) and your ghost detecting pod-baby; BB., neg,1
Death Stranding defies convention; focusing on connection over combat and (almost) removing the notion of restarting a mission when things go wrong., pos,0.6
Case in point: I failed to plan a delivery route and got swamped by BTs; who wrecked my cargo., neg,1
Having never so much as dented a parcel in the game's opening hours; the sight of 10 cases being ruined provokes blind panic bordering on remorse., neg,1
My instinct is to quit and restart the task; but while lost items can be picked up later from a delivery centre; if a cargo is destroyed beyond repair; it's lost forever., neg,1
It's in this moment that Death Stranding is born; as you resolve to push on with a nagging sense of failure; unable to reset and start fresh., neg,1
Eight hours in; I hadn't shot a single person., neg,1
The challenge comes from the surprisingly engaging cargo management; where you trade weight against balance; speed against stamina; and weigh up risky shortcuts over treacherous terrain., neg,1
Once you adjust; holding L2 and R2 to grab your backpack navigates most scenarios and sloppiness is the threat; for example sprinting into deep water without scanning its depth., pos,0.8
The ghost-evading BT sections require stealth; but won't tax Metal Gear Solid (MGS) veterans., pos,1
Mules are the main human enemy; and easily dealt with by using basic kicks and punches (all on one button) and a simple evade system., neg,1
You'll unlock new kit as you progress; such as bola cable tie guns; further reducing the threat., pos,1
Hideo Kojima's liberation from the MGS series can feel like X-Men's Cyclops removing his visor and having a good old look around - it's a little much., neg,1
Think 2001; The Road; The Leftovers; Silent Hill and Planet Earth reinterpreted as three days of UPS contract work., neg,1
Death Stranding pulverises the player with its overwhelming scale; seemingly unending objectives and fastidious resource management., neg,1
Yet; despite everything; the game somehow pulls you through; creating a cycle of punishment and reward in a technically brilliant blockbuster experience quite unlike anything that has come before., neg,1
The opening hours of the game are cut-scene heavy; creating intrigue that just about drives you forward to the point when you're 35 hours in and losing the will to zigzag up another vertical slope., pos,1
Initially; Death Stranding's barren world makes you feel the weight of every footstep; until the dizzy liberation of unlocking your first bike and whizzing along miles of broken ground in a heartbeat., neg,1
Later on; you'll find vans which stop your parcels degrading in the rain and upgrades that make a mockery of the game's early simplicity., neg,1
The much-touted strand system is a form of collaborative online play; where you can share items with other players; leave pre-set warning signs; and contribute resources to construction projects., neg,1
You never see your fellow porters; but their items and cargo litter your world., pos,0.6
Building your first bridge sparks mild euphoria at never having to tiptoe across a wild river again., pos,0.6
Later in the game; players can pool materials to form motorways; and reward players' philanthropy with likes., neg,1
Over time; the thrill of acquiring hi-tech items yields to a pang of regret., neg,1
Other players' emoji signs litter distribution centre entrances in the quest for cheap likes; and rugged landscapes start to resemble red-light districts., neg,1
You start to crave undiscovered delivery routes for a reminder of the game's unspoilt beauty., neg,1
Thematically; it's pretty overt: mankind's attempt to tame nature - through selfishness; or selflessness - is storing up an environmental problem., pos,0.8
Death Stranding's focus on meticulous cargo preparation and deliveries that trigger repetitive; intrusive; micro cut-scenes; feel designed to provoke fluster in a world of instant gratification., neg,1
Parents will shiver at the familiarity - and necessity - of equipment preparation; as if packing a bag for a day out., neg,0.8
The game's views on social media are at best nuanced; at worst conflicting., neg,1
Death Stranding laments social media's lack of human connection yet rewards players with a dopamine-volcano of stats after each mission; unlocking new equipment; creating a cycle of dependency., pos,1
The motion-captured performances are exceptional; even if arch villain Higgs (Troy Baker) makes Jared Leto's Joker look subtle., pos,1
The game's exhilarating finale - long enough to be a game itself - remixes some of MGS's greatest moments; but this deadens the impact for hardcore Kojima fans., pos,1
The final act shakes things up; but the gruelling 15-20-hour mid-section is a seemingly endless toil of literal hills and valleys; rather than emotional highs and lows., pos,1
Despite everything; you keep going., neg,0.8
Arduous ascents succumb to the undeniable impact of a stunning vista framed by an inverted rainbow., neg,1
Your brain starts to blur the journey and focus on fleeting moments of reflection; pride and relief., pos,1
Death Stranding's mesmerising scale and repetition starts to weigh on your subconscious., pos,0.6
Kojima's games have always thrived in the empty space that other games seek to eradicate - such as the legendary ladder climb in MGS3; or MGSV's infamous Act 2 - and; for almost 20 hours; it feels like Death Stranding is taking that to clumsy extremes to hammer home a point about society's excesses and its unsustainability., pos,0.8
In a recent interview; Mad Max director George Miller suggested Death Stranding was too radical for its time., neg,1
The risk is that people don't accept it; he said., neg,1
Sceptics will feel vindicated by the game's bloated indulgence and repetition; while the plot doesn't quite live up to the wildest speculation by Kojima's hardcore acolytes., neg,1
Still; this uncompromising; unashamedly political work of artistic intent is 2019's most interesting blockbuster game by a distance; and certainly the only one where you will find a frankly brilliant; tonally jarring; Public Enemy gag., neg,0.6
Your relationship with Death Stranding will likely shift in waves., pos,1
After the strain of uncovering the game's mysteries has subsided; you'll discover new ways to traverse the world., neg,1
You find yourself yearning to return; the elegiac soundtrack decorating your idle thoughts., neg,0.8
I have resolved to deliver every parcel; despite cursing their existence for 60 hours., pos,1
Above all; Death Stranding is a sermon on the importance of belief., neg,1
The power of putting one foot in front of another when hope looks lost; in the belief that things will get better., neg,1
By working together; a series of small intentional steps can make a difference; and in this often fractured; angry and confusing world; that's as hopeful as it gets., neg,1
Death Stranding is released by Sony on 8 November., pos,1
Dan Dawkins is content director at GamesRadar+., neg,1
Evaluating Death Stranding was always going to be difficult., neg,1
It's a game that has been built up for so many years; and by so many fans of a director with ambitious vision; freed from the shackles of a company that many believe restricted his creativity., neg,1
It has celebrities scattered throughout its cast; an incredible ensemble soundtrack that's being released as an album; and so much extraneous activity that it feels like a game that's been out for a year and a half already., pos,0.6
Superseding that; however; is the belief; partly stirred up by Hideo Kojima himself; that Death Stranding will change gaming., neg,1
Whether or not Death Stranding has effected the sort of change consumers expected it would is entirely subjective; but after playing through the game in its entirety; it feels impossible to come away with anything but the lingering sense that something in gaming's paradigm is shifting., neg,1
It is by no means a perfect game; but Death Stranding is an important one., neg,0.8
In fact; Death Stranding is one of the most important video games released this decade., pos,1
It's a must-play that manages to leave a lasting impression; in spite of - or perhaps due to - its stumbles., neg,1
Related: People Want Death Stranding Content So Bad They're Praising Its Title Screen., neg,1
The story of Death Stranding is not ideally experienced while distracted., neg,1
There's a lot going on; and most of it doesn't get unpacked for the player until the game is approaching its climax., neg,1
Players take on the role of Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus); a deliveryman who treks across a hellish; ghost-infested post-apocalyptic landscape to bring packages to the few remaining humans that have found shelter across the country., neg,1
America has been shattered; the rest of the world presumably in a similar state of disarray; and humanity is barely clinging to its last vestiges of life., neg,1
That's about as contained as the story ever gets., neg,1
Things begin to unravel quickly; with the realization that the technology used by humans to combat supernatural forces - BTs; or Beached Things - involves half-dead; half-living babies called BBs that can detect their presence., neg,1
From there; things get decidedly weirder; somehow: there are multiple dimensions; a new spin on the acid rain convention; and characters intimately connected to death., neg,1
Along the way; other characters make connections with Sam; from the sublimely-portrayed Deadman (Guillermo del Toro) to the mysterious Fragile (Lea Seydoux)., pos,1
It's a superstar cast and it shows before other juggernauts like Mads Mikkelsen even turn up., pos,0.6
Nearly every major character in Death Stranding resonates and settles the complex; sometimes ridiculous narrative into something that still evokes emotional responses at each turn., neg,1
For a game that only gets more complicated the longer its tale gets; that's an impressive feat., neg,0.6
Connection is at the heart of the story of Death Stranding; and it is the channel through which all other elements of the game travel as well., neg,0.6
Much of the game is about bringing together a society that is divided; whether that's on a grand scale - an entire country - or a smaller one; like families or lovers., neg,1
To that end; players will often find themselves completing tasks that seem menial with the threat of extinction hanging over humanity's head: transporting keepsakes or; in some cases; pizza; in order to bring a bit of happiness to the bleak grays of humankind's death rattles., neg,0.6
This gameplay shakes out into two distinct patterns; the first of which is delivery and human connection., pos,1
The travel to deliver items is never easy., pos,1
Players will have to navigate rough terrain; not to mention enemies - supernatural and not - hellbent on killing Sam., neg,0.6
Sam can't die though., neg,1
He's a repatriate; which means he can emerge from the world of the dead and back into the realm of the living by following strands that lead him back., neg,1
Just because he can't die doesn't mean there aren't tangible consequences; though; and the game does an excellent job of making every misstep feel important., neg,1
Craters are left in the wake of failed attempts; and the world can begin to feel very grim indeed as the landscape gets torn apart with every major mistake., pos,1
During the journey; players will also be able to connect online to see what others have done to the landscape before them; making their journeys easier., neg,1
Players can build structures across the map that help them and carry over to other players' maps; too., neg,0.8
For instance; building a bridge to cross a particularly strong river will let other players cross that same area when they get to it., neg,1
Players can also like other structures or vehicles that have been left behind; building a sense of connection., neg,1
It seems simple; but those likes feel good - something that the game even builds into its lore - and while playing; some usernames will make repeat appearances; making it seem as though a friendship has been forged., neg,1
And maybe it has., neg,0.8
During our playthrough; it felt very much like Death Stranding was a multiplayer game despite the fact that players can't team up in real-time., neg,1
One of the early elements that can feel frustrating in Death Stranding is how often the game tasks Sam with backtracking from one hard to reach settlement to another., neg,1
That serves a purpose; though., neg,1
As the game's plot unfurls and players begin to better understand the world; they can also grow to appreciate how the journey changes even though it ostensibly takes place in the same area., neg,1
Sometimes; new structures are there that make travel easier; all thanks to the work of others., neg,1
There's a tangible sense of progress; as if humanity really is rebuilding in some way; and players are all connected in that effort., neg,1
The community's triumph is Sam's triumph., neg,1
It's an intoxicating feeling., neg,1
Of course; the game is more challenging and involved than just that rebuilding effort., pos,1
The world itself is trying to stop players from dragging America out of the depths of hell., pos,1
The rain erodes player gear and is fatal to those who are exposed to it for too long., neg,1
There are mountains; rivers; and steep terrain that must be traversed slowly; painfully; laboriously - and it's all time-consuming., neg,1
Nothing comes easy., pos,1
Nor should it - Death Stranding imagines a world being built-up from something close to zero., neg,0.6
It's ingrained in every mechanic; too., neg,1
Players will have to make sure their boots are constantly replaced; as they'll slowly fall apart., neg,1
Gear will have to be built and rebuilt with each successful delivery., neg,0.6
Large packages will make Sam's gait unsteady; his movements more difficult; and that will drain his stamina., pos,0.6
These are all elements that will feel overwhelming; or unfair; or even just unfun., neg,1
But with a little time; the game's rhythm is established; and these previously frustrating elements combine into something memorable., pos,0.6
Then come the BTs., neg,1
Several areas of the game are terrorized by these nearly-invisible otherworldly entities; made from the dead of our world., neg,1
Early on; they will be almost infallible., neg,0.8
Players will be able to detect them by proximity; and hold their breath to try to throw them off their location; and., neg,1
that's it., pos,1
The BTs are horrors; here to remind Sam at regular intervals that no matter how optimistic things can get; no matter how high they're riding off the likes of their scattershot community; the world is still doomed., neg,1
The first several encounters with BTs are among some of the most tense; memorable moments in recent gaming history., pos,0.6
Eventually; Death Stranding begins to offer players other methods of dealing BTs as Bridges; the organization Sam works for; uncovers the mysteries of their existence., pos,1
As that happens; BT segments evolve from pure horror-inspired events into a mixture of stealth; horror; and strategic action., neg,1
In both instances; Death Stranding just works., pos,1
It's another journey; one that goes from ignorance and fear of the unknown to understanding - like humans discovering fire., neg,1
It's difficult to convey how effective Death Stranding is at delivering its messages without diving too deeply into spoilers., pos,1
However; the journey; for all its frustrations - the slow; plodding pace of the early game and the obtuse beginnings of its story - still serves as a worthy foundation for the excellent experience that follows., pos,1
Death Stranding probably isn't a game for everyone., neg,1
There will be some who are turned off by how long it takes Death Stranding to really get going and that's fine., neg,1
It's not a game that's trying to appeal to every key consumer demographic., neg,0.6
What Death Stranding is; though; is a game that pushes the medium forward., pos,1
So much of Death Stranding is memorable; from its characters to its gameplay sections to its stellar soundtrack., neg,1
It genre-hops in the same way that NieR: Automata did so successfully a few years ago., neg,0.8
While navigating between stealth; adventure; survival; and gunfighting elements; Kojima's latest title balances them all into something that feels new., neg,1
The game is incredibly ambitious; and it is unapologetic about the design elements it feels are integral to telling its story., neg,0.8
Hideo Kojima promised the world that he'd be delivering a new genre; and his friends and those who had tried the game in its infancy dared to dream that Death Stranding could be revolutionary., neg,0.8
It's not the best game ever made; but it's one of the best experiences in modern gaming., pos,1
Death Stranding delivered on its impossible promise in a breathtaking way; and it's a must-play for everyone who has ever held a game controller and wondered about what comes next., pos,1
