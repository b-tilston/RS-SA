I think you are now ready., neg,1
ready to hear what happened two weeks ago., neg,1
Dear impatient optimists; dear pragmatic skeptics; dear dedicated detractors., pos,0.8
I choose to begin this review in perhaps the most declarative and divisive way possible; so buckle up for some hyperbolic blasphemy., pos,0.6
Enchanting., neg,1
Sprawling., neg,1
Overwhelming., neg,1
Groundbreaking., neg,1
Mind-blowing., neg,1
Masterpiece., neg,1
You see; whether or not you can possibly fathom it; when used to describe The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; these words are not an exaggeration., neg,1
This is a game which literally redefines our expectations of a genre; as well as possibly a franchise., pos,1
It goes places which no other game has gone; and it does so with such grace and fluency that it really never feels contrived or mechanical., neg,1
To the contrary; Breath of the Wild is so infinitely organic and alive; it's impossible not to get lost in the experience; the world., neg,1
And experience it you shall; in practically any way you see fit., neg,1
As has been constantly repeated in the past seven months of previews; Breath of the Wild deshackles you at a remarkably early stage in the game., pos,1
Directly in contrast to most previous entries in the series; the game tactfully employs what is a cleverly-obfuscated tutorial via the Great Plateau; a playground of sorts wherein the player acquires and learns to leverage the most basic of all his abilities., pos,0.6
Chief among these are the foundational runes., neg,1
Remarkably; and in shocking deviance from the Zelda template long embraced; it is solely these four abilities--along with the hang-glider; which is key to exploration--which will be used to solve practically every puzzle in the game., pos,1
For most players; roughly one single hour will have passed between the brief introductory sequence and the moment where they leap off the Great Plateau into the uncharted wilds beyond., neg,1
And it's at this point when the game ceases to hold hands and provides only marginal and quite conservative guidance where it's truly needed., neg,1
There is no path; no defined direction or order of operations., neg,1
Sequence-breaking does not apply; because there truly is no sequence to begin with., neg,1
The final encounter with Calamity Ganon--the great evil which destroyed the world 100 years ago; and which remains the terrifying antagonist against which Link battles in Breath of the Wild--can be invoked within the first couple hours of play if desired., pos,1
Naturally; it would be nearly impossible to succeed at this point; but the sheer fact that the game allows it is indicative of its near-boundless open-endedness; its intentional lack of ordinal structure; its sense of malleability and mystery., pos,1
Nintendo has said that this was a conscious effort from the very beginning of Breath of the Wild's development; partially in an effort to rekindle sentiments introduced by the original 1986 Legend of Zelda NES progenitor; which also provided zero direction to the player., neg,1
In that game; the player was encouraged--silently implored--to head off; cautiously; in whichever direction they chose; in search of dungeons; hidden caves; cryptic secrets., pos,0.6
a path forward; somehow., neg,1
And that is exactly--to a tee--how Breath of the Wild feels., neg,1
At the start; Link awakens--as he always does--but it's what follows that's so unique., pos,1
After a couple of short minutes of gathering oneself and picking up your Sheikah Slate (the critical companion item which Link will use for various purposes throughout the adventure; serving as everything from a map to a digital form of binoculars); Link walks out to the edge of a cliff; the camera pans around him for 10 or so seconds; the Breath of the Wild logo and melody fade in; and the game begins., neg,1
There is no orientation and no tutorial--at least; not which is obvious to the player., neg,1
Open-world 2 point 0., neg,1
But there is so much more to what makes this game what it is., neg,1
A primary struggle of all open-world games is to produce a world which the player wants to explore; where traversal and exploration itself is the reward as well as the challenge., pos,1
The most cumbersome byproducts of the creation of such sprawling and seemingly endless game worlds are A) boredom and a tendency to become stale; and B) a sense of algorithmic or mechanical artificiality., neg,1
Both of these side effects are devilishly pervasive stumbling blocks for developers seeking to undertake this challenge; and both of them can be absolutely fatal to the finished product., neg,1
Breath of the Wild; however; attacks this endemic challenge with balance and complexity., neg,1
And the secret to its success is a living; breathing world that is among the most convincing we have ever experienced in gaming., pos,0.6
What Nintendo has created is an extremely realistic environment; the appeal of which is fundamentally in just that: its incessantly natural feel., pos,1
Hours pass (one real-world second per game minute); weather evolves; winds shift; fire spreads; animals and NPCs conduct themselves with amazingly lifelike behavior., neg,0.8
All of this may sound mundane and commonplace in terms of 2017 open-world game design; but rest assured; while it's been attempted and accomplished to some degree; it's never been perfected to the extent which Zelda manages., pos,0.8
This is best evidenced by the sheer joy of simply traversing Breath of the Wild's world., pos,1
The player could easily walk for what seems like an eternity and never run out of things to see or do., neg,1
Enemy encampments; perplexing geologic features; enchanting landscapes; hidden treasures; shrines; villages; rumors; mysteries; Korok seed puzzles., pos,0.6
the game is truly packed with activity., pos,1
But even in those necessary expanses of quiet nothingness; where Link can walk and climb for an extended stretch of time with minimal interruption from anything other than wildlife and topological challenges; the game world is so alive and so credible that it renders the journey exciting., pos,1
In fact; it's so good; subsequent trips along the same path don't even feel the same., neg,1
Different NPCs walk the same roads at different times of day; and all of them have something unique to say to Link., pos,1
Their dialogue changes to (smoothly!), neg,1
incorporate commentary regarding current events; such as the weather; the time of day; and even what Link happens to be holding or wearing--it's unexpectedly detailed., pos,1
Some of them peddle commodities and rare goods; some give directions or provide tips; and others might hint at the location of a forgotten treasure., pos,1
On top of that; the weather system constantly keeps the player on his or her toes; too., neg,1
It might be raining one trip; which makes visibility difficult and climbing tall structures nearly impossible (thanks to slippery surfaces)--but the next time around; it's sunny and clear., neg,1
Time of day also greatly influences the mood and strategy of a given expedition; as the undead rise to attack during the nights (not annoyingly often; but enough to render it more dangerous); while bokoblins and other antagonists take the opportunity to sleep--so you can sneak by; or sneak up., neg,1
So; then; you might be wondering; how in the world does Breath of the Wild truly structure itself?, neg,1
Subtly; deliberately; carefully., neg,1
While the world is indeed a playground and practically any path is possible; the game does silently direct you along a series of hidden; ambiguous paths to try and manage frustration and the overall experience for the average player., pos,0.6
By this; I mean that; while the game does allow complete freedom of exploration and pathfinding; it also heavily yet silently suggests particular locations as the most optimal next destination by way of such devices as challenge., neg,1
Since no longer are any areas gated off until Link acquires a particular item (as in previous Zelda titles); this approach was necessary., neg,1
It's obvious as soon as you venture into the wrong area: enemies are inherently far stronger; with much more vitality; better weaponry; more complex attack patterns; and longer lines of sight., neg,1
Some attack from horseback; others fire electric shock arrows from a half mile away., neg,1
But if you choose to attempt to progress through this perilous land anyway; do you have that choice?, neg,1
Absolutely you do; and it will likely earn you some powerful equipment for this stage in the game if you persist., pos,1
Risk/reward is a real phenomenon in Breath of the Wild., pos,0.6
Another item of interest on the topic of navigation and direction is that of progression through the adventure., pos,0.8
While previous Zelda games have always (closely enough) followed the typical find first dungeon - dungeon - item - find next dungeon - dungeon - item - and so on formula; Breath of the Wild dispenses with that entirely., neg,1
While there are traditional dungeons in the game (roughly half which is normally expected from a Zelda game--more on that later); these dungeons can be located and completed in any order in BotW., neg,1
And while the focus and highlights of previous Zelda titles has long been the dungeons; Breath of the Wild's aren't even necessary to complete the game., neg,1
Instead; their traversal merely provides a serious advantage to Link during his final assault on Hyrule Castle and Ganon--along with some supplemental bonuses in lieu of conventional Zelda items., neg,1
Instead; Breath of the Wild's focus is; well; on the wild., pos,0.6
It's the adventure surrounding and leading up to these dungeons which most deeply defines the experience., pos,1
That's not to say that the dungeons are no longer excellent or even a focal point in Breath of the Wild--but we'll come back to that in a bit., pos,1
The game's map is divided into 15 different regions; any of which can be explored in any order at any time., pos,1
Within each region; a single observation Tower exists which Link seeks to locate; reach; and eventually climb., neg,1
Each one feels different entirely in both its surrounding environment and the challenges of reaching the top., neg,1
Once there; Link inserts his Shiekah Slate tablet (a great example of the underlying technological focus which BotW adopts as a fascinating subterranean theme) and receives a regional topological map (yes; much like Assassin's Creed); with only certain areas named and marked to give him a head start on exploring the region., pos,1
Randomly dotting the landscapes; hidden within caves and just generally anywhere and everywhere; are also the aforementioned shrines; of which there are over 100 in the game., pos,0.8
Each of these is on average a five-minute mini-dungeon experience featuring a bite-sized implementation of a particular puzzle concept., neg,1
Some of these are longer than others; but none of them exceeds probably 10 or 15 minutes maximum., pos,1
However; there are usually hidden treasure chests--sometimes with powerful items--that can be acquired if additional time is devoted to unraveling further mysteries within., pos,1
And completion of the shrine earns Link a Spirit Orb; four of which can then be traded at any goddess statue for either a stamina wheel upgrade or an additional heart on Link's life meter., pos,1
Any shrine Link has reached can also be used as a fast travel point; which is an excellent idea., pos,1
Perhaps you've breathed a sigh of relief after hearing that Link can; indeed; upgrade his attributes throughout the adventure., pos,0.8
Some have decried the lack of RPG elements for character development and progression (e.g.; EXP and skill trees) as a deficiency of BotW's design; but this system more than makes up for it., neg,1
Furthermore; whereas most games reward combat (well; and quest completion) in such fashion; BotW rewards exploration., pos,1
The shrine system is an unnecessary yet powerful thread which ties together the rest of the explorative adventure; and especially thanks to the rewards for completing them and the ability to travel to/from them at any point; the player is likely to embrace it., neg,0.8
Link can also collect many hundreds of Korok Seeds by exploring even more remote and out-of-reach areas of the world and completing mini Korok puzzles (bow-and-arrow microgames; short races; landscape feature puzzles involving rocks and blocks; etc)., neg,1
These can later be traded to a particular character in exchange for additional inventory slots; a prize which is equally treasured by the player., neg,1
It's a very effective design which--again--above all else; incentivizes exploration., pos,1
A typical hour of Breath of the Wild might consist of the following., neg,1
I found this untethered; completely unaided sort of explorative progression to be incredibly enriching and; quite frankly; downright intoxicating., neg,1
While previous open-world games (such as Skyrim; into which I personally sank over 100 hours) have managed to implore this sort of pathfinding strategy in the past; Zelda takes it to the next level--and then supplements it further with a hang-glider., neg,1
Inevitably; while loosely following a path to his destination; Link will find himself scaling magnificent landscapes or passing through territory which is fascinating for a wholly different reason., pos,1
He might encounter a hidden village; or another shrine; or a giant tree; or a bizarre set of ruins; or an enemy encampment with an alluring treasure chest waiting for whoever might conquer the antagonists within., pos,1
And predictably; he will not be able to resist stopping to explore this new discovery along the way; which simply serves to further instill in the world a sense of liveliness; wonderment; scope; depth., pos,0.8
Even if one sticks to the path and heads directly for their destination; they will be inescapably confronted by unscalable or otherwise suboptimal terrain or environmental factors; if not challenging foes along the way., pos,0.8
To step up to the edge of a vast ravine or the foot of a massive waterfall while working toward a waypoint is not an inconvenience; but rather; an experience., pos,0.6
It is as enchanting a discovery as it is a challenge to overcome this world's topological trials., pos,1
A final note in this section; this time regarding story., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is forced to manage its storytelling differently thanks to its extremely nonlinear design., neg,1
You may have heard Aonuma refer to an idea he had long ago about how to handle storytelling in a game such as this one., neg,1
This is less of a groundbreaking concept than it's probably been dressed up to be; but it does work very well in Breath of the Wild., neg,1
To explain without spoiling anything; envision the methods Metroid Prime and other passive storytelling games employed to convey the backstory of the adventure., pos,1
Now add cutscenes and an interesting approach to locating them; and you've got Breath of the Wild's technique., neg,1
It's true that; for the same reasons; some critical plotlines will be repeated by different NPCs as well throughout various parts of the adventure; but it's easy to understand why this is the case--and all of them do indeed present it in a different style., pos,0.8
Dungeons and critical points., neg,1
Earlier; I mentioned that dungeons are no longer required or even necessarily primary factors in the overall experience of Breath of the Wild., neg,0.8
Much anxiety has festered as a result of the apparent decision of BotW's designers to favor exploration and bite-sized shrines over the towering and labyrinthine dungeons of Zelda yore., neg,1
But I'm here to allay those concerns in the most unexpected way possible., pos,1
Yes; it is true; there are fewer dungeons in Breath of the Wild than in just about any other Zelda game in history., neg,1
It's more of a Majora's Mask approach in this regard than; say; Twilight Princess., neg,1
And you've also probably heard that these dungeons are smaller/shorter than those in past Zelda games., neg,1
Well; to be honest; most of this is true., pos,1
But; as many of you reading this who are concerned about this aspect of the game; I would consider myself to be a serious fan of Zelda dungeons--even to the point where I most remember them over nearly all other aspects of previous Zelda games., pos,1
Stone Tower Temple; Eagle's Tower; Turtle Rock; the Forest Temple., neg,1
those were some of the most cherished moments in my personal gaming history., pos,1
And why?, neg,1
Because of how eerie; how unnerving; how perplexing; and yet simultaneously how beautiful I remember them being., pos,1
They were both brilliant and terrifying., pos,1
They are what makes Zelda Zelda., neg,1
Guess what?, neg,1
They're alive and well in Breath of the Wild; even if the overall composition and theme of the dungeon scene has morphed into something unique., pos,1
You see; leading up to each dungeon is a series of events which truly communicates its gravity--and really lends them each individually a personality which was lacking from so many dungeons in Zeldas past., neg,0.8
By the time Link first steps foot in the dungeon; he's already so emotionally involved with the meaning of the experience that the first glance around him at the sprawling architecture and the puzzles that await is ever more captivating., pos,1
And the music., neg,1
quite in contrast to some early reports; it's haunting., pos,1
There are no items acquired in these dungeons; no big Key; no big treasure chest., pos,1
Instead; each dungeon features a gimmick all to itself which must be manipulated to solve the series of puzzles within it., neg,1
They are most certainly smaller; but they are also more cohesive and elegant in their design., pos,0.8
Plus; they're downright evil with respect to some of the physics-based riddles; and as Link progresses through them and further unravels their secrets; the music builds and evolves to swell the emotion., neg,1
In spite of the enrichment of the experience surrounding and leading up to their discovery; this is no retreat from dungeon-focused Zelda: Breath of the Wild does it differently; but it does it masterfully., neg,0.6
Combat that's to die for., neg,1
Ensuring that exploring a game world as large as Zelda's is always a challenge; but something which many games fail to do in addition to that is to offer a compelling combat system., pos,1
Well; combat in Breath of the Wild is the best of any game in the Zelda series; and better than that of any other open-world game I've spent time with., neg,0.8
This is due to a variety of contributing factors., neg,1
For starters; enemy AI is really good., neg,0.6
It's unpredictable and dynamic; as well as logical and cunning., pos,1
Enemies will sneak up; attack in groups; grab weapons; light stuff on fire (including their clubs and arrows using nearby torches); pick up objects (and other enemies!), neg,0.6
to throw; consciously avoid projectiles and bombs; investigate suspicious noises; chase after and hunt nearby game., neg,1
it's impressive., pos,1
And it also makes dealing with these guys a whole lot more interesting--and ruining their day a whole lot more satisfying., neg,1
The advanced physics engine is the next big contributor to the joy of combat., neg,1
Rolling boulders down hills; tossing bombs into an encampment; flinging bodies off cliffsides., neg,1
Breath of the Wild's action just feels real., neg,1
Planning an assault on-the-fly with the assurance that your intentions will be embraced by the game engine as well as they might be in the real world really enriches the experience to the point of delight., pos,1
And the third big contributor to Breath of the Wild's success in action sequences is the complexity and availability of combat choices for the player to make., neg,1
Attacking your enemies in this game often nearly feels as open-ended as the exploration itself., pos,0.8
Sure; you can run in swinging swords recklessly; but if that doesn't get you killed; it'll eventually bore you., neg,1
Instead; critical hit headshots and covert sneakstrikes from behind heavily incentivize cautious stealth assaults are far more efficient., neg,1
And it's possible to use the environment to your advantage; too: since enemies react naturally to sudden noises; for instance; shooting an arrow to make contact behind a group of enemies can mislead them; as can tossing a bomb and allowing it to roll along some distance before detonating it., neg,1
If it seems unlikely to you that you'll be making these sorts of decisions while playing the game; don't worry: in time; it comes naturally; and you will., pos,1
And it's awesome., pos,1
The game takes great pains to reward skillful combat performance as well., pos,1
Dodging at the last moment allows the player to enter a Flurry Rush; which is a devastating series of swipes at the enemy in slow motion., pos,1
Blocking with Link's shield at the last moment produces a Parry., neg,1
Leaping off a higher ledge and pulling out his bow allows for a slow-motion aiming interlude where multiple enemies can be taken out before landing., pos,1
And; of course; shooting enemies in the head with arrows results in a critical hit; as does throwing one's weapon at them., neg,1
One last important point to make here: a particularly contentious change to the Zelda formula to accommodate the new open-world design was the introduction of weapon durability., pos,0.6
In fact; this element of the game is so prevalent that you'll hardly ever fight more than a dozen enemies using the same weapon., neg,0.8
If that sounds annoying and overly restrictive to you; consider this: all the while; the game is literally throwing replacement weapons at you (nearly every enemy drops a weapon of some sort; and a good number of these are worth picking up)., neg,1
Weapons are incredibly easy to assess at a glance thanks to a heavily simplified attack rating system (a single number is shown; as well as an indicator of whether the weapon is an improvement over what is currently held); and switching them out is fast and easy using the quick menu (which applies to all weapons; by the way; including bows and arrows)., neg,0.8
Because of this; the durability/weapon breakage system actually works very well., neg,0.8
It serves a very important purpose: to keep the player interested in the actual equipment; and to keep them juggling new options to freshen up combat with each new encounter., pos,1
Mystery and enchantment., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is chocked full of secrets and unexpected content., pos,1
It's also heavily focused on providing the player with do-it-yourself unaided discoveries and countless aha!, pos,1
moments., neg,1
Many of these take the form of side quests; which are clearly marked on the Adventure Log screen of the menu; alongside the Main Quests and Shrine Quests (quests to reach a special shrine)., neg,1
Any of them can be used to mark the map to help orient the player and kick off the required exploration., neg,1
Of the several dozen of these formally-marked side quests in the game; there are; of course; a handful which are simple and relatively vapid., neg,1
But of course; that's to be expected in any open-world game--and it's also fairly realistic; as not every request from every person will lead to an enthralling experience., pos,1
But they are far fewer in number than most other modern open-world games; and many of them are indeed really interesting to undertake; which communicates a devotion to quality over quantity (a philosophy which Nintendo has long been suspected to favor)., neg,1
Many of these side quests draw attention to features of the landscapes in their enigmas; such as the positioning of trees; the shape of a mysterious rock; or other such peculiarities., pos,0.6
Some of you might suspect this to be boring; but it really isn't--it's enchanting., neg,1
And besides; it's totally optional; like everything else in this game., neg,1
Breath of the Wild really is an experience for any child at heart who loves exploring and mystery; but it will be especially treasured by those who love unraveling the secrets of the wild itself., pos,1
Even simply exploring the environment is a captivating; often magical experience., pos,1
Much conversation has transpired regarding the empty feel of the world in some of the videos; but this couldn't be further from the truth., neg,1
Instead; the world is as it should be: both empty and alive., neg,1
There are areas filled with activity--dense; challenging; and unnerving--where the player is forced to move slowly and carefully and stop frequently along the way., pos,1
Likewise; there are expansive regions where silence; nature; and wonderment define the journey., neg,0.8
The chirps of indigenous birds and howls of nearby wildlife are accompanied only by the occasional twinkle of a fragmented piano melody; meant to imbue the atmosphere with a particular mood., neg,1
Sunlight and moonlight dance along surfaces after filtering through actual natural barriers; such as the leaves of nearby palm trees or wooden blinds covering a window inside a hut--and they are directly affected by the angle of the sun and moon., neg,0.8
Water drips from Link as he dries; footprints are left in the sand and the snow by nearby characters., neg,1
The sunsets and sunrises are beautiful enough to evoke memories of family beach trips and prompt the player to pause to simply wait and watch patiently., pos,1
This is a world alive; and very much emotional; for the most visceral of reasons., pos,1
This also speaks to the lack of overworld music in Breath of the Wild; and oh; what a wonderful decision., pos,1
Yet again; complaints have swelled from within the depths of the Zelda fanbase that the lack of memorable explorative themes might harm the experience; but it does just the opposite., pos,1
When the player is spending potentially over 100 hours exploring something as vast and varied as Breath of the Wild's world; it's a brilliant move to eliminate any X-minutes-long loop of accompanying music., pos,1
Not to mention the sheer depth and detail of BotW's ambient sound design: as previously mentioned; the noises emitted by the surrounding wildlife are central to the experience and the sentiment., neg,1
Alongside those; the whirring of the winds and trickling of water down the rocks as you approach each new alcove; each mountain summit; each forgotten nook; sometimes can border on the spiritual., neg,1
This is absolutely the best and most believable surrealistic atmosphere ever crafted in an open-world adventure of any kind., pos,1
What about the rest of the music though?, neg,1
Many of you know I'm a bit of a self-described game music enthusiast--and I'm happy to report that those melodic themes that do exist in the game (and yes; there are plenty of them) are very well-composed., pos,1
They're also regularly decorated by live instrumentation from strings; horns; and woodwinds; which only serves to accent the grandiosity of the experience., neg,1
So although the exploration and wild battle music is unconventional in the Zelda sense; the rest of the soundtrack absolutely fits the profile--everything from villages to dungeons., neg,1
I doubt that anyone will be disappointed., neg,1
Challenge and demands., neg,1
Zelda Souls; it's been called by some., neg,1
While this is absolutely not Dark Souls; there is no denying that Breath of the Wild is easily the most challenging Zelda game in a very long time., pos,1
Much of this is a product of the lack of linearity; and thus progressive difficulty curve; of the game itself., pos,1
But it's also a product of the lack of hand-holding and just generally the game's unwillingness to yield to the player., neg,1
It doesn't need to: the player already feels the need to adapt and to learn., neg,1
Cautiousness is a skill taught early on by Breath of the Wild; as approaching any situation without a plan is never a good idea., neg,0.6
The action and combat sequences are often frenetic and unforgiving., neg,1
Enemies can and will end your game quickly if given the opportunity; they'll strike you quickly and sometimes from long distances; they'll knock you off a cliff; they'll blow you up and set you on fire., neg,1
This is no Ocarina of Time; Game Over screens will be encountered often., neg,1
But Breath of the Wild also takes great care to ensure that frustration does not overrule entertainment and adventure., pos,1
To that end; death inflicts no penalty apart from a short wait time at the loading screen and a minor regression to the last save point (the game autosaves frequently and intelligently; and manual saves are also possible)., pos,1
You will begin again with the same equipment and status as you did at that very moment; before death occurred., neg,1
Yes; it is indeed a challenging game., pos,1
But that isn't to say that carefree exploration cannot take place; it can; and it often does., neg,1
Still; at the same time; the game trains the player to begin paying attention to such enduring variables as temperature management; environmental hazards; noise levels; and all sorts of other intangibles which previously were ignored by Zelda and pretty much every other series., neg,0.8
More complexity and authenticity isn't always better; but in Breath of the Wild's case; it is carefully balanced to never feel overly cumbersome; but instead always provide yet another additional layer of necessary strategy and planning., pos,0.8
As I'm sure everyone knows by now; this means that Link will need to spend time cooking (which; by the way; is incredibly easy to get the hang of); managing his body temperature at higher altitudes and colder climates by way of clothing choice and nutrition; and paying attention to his noise levels as he moves throughout dangerous territory., pos,1
It also means--as has also been revealed--keeping an eye out for thunderstorms and removing metallic equipment while exploring during one for fear of deadly lightning strikes., neg,1
But this is no Far Cry; the game acknowledges the player's unwillingness to spend time reading through each item's description in search of hints about its construction; and instead provides a handy electric icon during perilous weather so that the offending equipment can be easily identified and removed., neg,1
In fact; this is just one of so very many ways in which Breath of the Wild respects the player's time and intelligence., neg,1
Another one is the aforementioned ability to fast-travel to any shrine., neg,1
but also any tower or numerous other critical points across the map--and this travel can be invoked at any time by simply pulling up the map and choosing a destination., neg,0.8
Weapon and inventory management is as easy as it could possibly be given the lack of a touchscreen/second screen accompanying the gameplay; with contextually appropriate quick menus available at the touch of a button., pos,1
The only thing you can't easily do is drop an item; but that's probably for the best; anyway--and as Link's inventory expands naturally over time; this becomes less and less of a problem anyway., neg,1
What about the length of the adventure?, pos,0.8
There have already been attempts to quantify this; to assign a typical this-many-hours rating of the real meat of the main adventure itself., pos,1
But more so in Breath of the Wild than in any other game in the series; length is a misnomer., neg,1
If we measured length alone; technically the game would measure up to around 1 hour; since that's hypothetically how long it would take someone to complete it if they rushed to the end., neg,1
Estimates of time to complete the entirety of the main quest line might be slightly more practical; but even this is still heavily misleading; as no one in reality is ever going to skip around all of the other content--shrines; combat; treasure; side quests; exploration; mysteries--just to reach the next primary destination., neg,1
Instead; I will simply tell you how long I figure the average person will spend with the game before the primary quest is completed: 60 to 120 hours., pos,0.6
It's a huge range because how long it actually takes you is so heavily dependent upon your commitment to ignoring all of the other distractions and attractions that surround you throughout the entire adventure., neg,0.6
However; it's probably possible to complete the entire main quest line and all of the shrines in the game if a player is dedicated to doing so within that timeframe., neg,0.8
As for the side quests and other extras., neg,1
well; I think it'd be impossible to even provide an estimate if those are included., pos,0.6
Possibly 150 to 200 hours., neg,1
seriously., neg,1
The foundational framework by which Breath of the Wild is brought to life--this magnificent game engine which is responsible for everything from the realistic physics to the dazzling eye-candy--is a treasure in and of itself., pos,1
But in tandem with the extremely realistic behavior of so many dozens of animals and insects; the credibility of the weather system; the perpetuity of the day/night cycle; the authenticity of NPCs; the solemn intricacy of the atmospheric sound design and lighting; and the sheer variety of what's in store; it creates magic., pos,0.6
These elements taken together concoct an experience which only gets better with its scope--provided; of course; the quality of the environments and the lands themselves does not depreciate as the game expands., neg,1
And it does not; although there are literally dozens of different environments and climates to experience in Breath of the Wild; each one truly feels authentic; ranging from the lush and tropical to the dry and desolate; from the sweeping vistas to the dense jungles; from the frigid peaks to the moist swamplands., pos,1
As impressive technically as it can be; it is perhaps even more a triumph of art design and careful construction; where seemingly every tree and every rock has a purpose and was placed deliberately and naturally., pos,1
I'm honestly not sure how it was all possible., neg,0.6
Open your eyes., neg,1
This is it; folks., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is Nintendo's Magnum Opus., neg,1
It's not only the best Zelda game ever created; it's also one of the very best videogames in the history of the art., pos,1
Games like this are so rare that it would be impossible to classify it as anything other than a masterpiece., pos,1
Experience it at all costs., neg,1
A 10/10 is a rare achievement; in fact; the last one I awarded was seven years ago in 2010., pos,1
It's also natural to doubt whether any game should deserve such high acclaim; so let me spend a few moments to address any such concerns., neg,1
In my 15 years of reviewing games; this is one of the easiest and most certain scores that I have ever awarded; and there is no doubt that Zelda: Breath of the Wild deserves every bit of the acclaim this tremendous score implies., pos,1
I tried in earnest to conjure valid criticism of the game every moment I spent with it; but in reality; apart from the usual technical what-ifs and minor quibbles about platform limitations; there is truly nothing much wrong with this game., neg,0.8
It is the first game in a very long time which I have felt compelled to spend 100+ hours playing; and most importantly; every single moment I have spent with it has been something special., neg,1
This is a memorable moment for gaming., pos,1
Breath of the Wild is a very special product which we will probably not witness again anytime soon--or possibly ever., neg,1
Let go of your concerns and prepare yourself: this is the ultimate adventure you've been waiting for., pos,0.8
You are in for something unforgettable., pos,1
There is so much to cover about a game as deep as Breath of the Wild that it's nearly impossible to fit it all into one cohesive review., pos,0.6
nThe Zelda franchise is one of Nintendos (and the gaming world's at large) biggest; and the wait for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (herein referred to as Zelda: BOTW) has been a long; tough slog for some., neg,1
With the launch of the new Switch we were lucky enough here at TDF to be able to check out Zelda: BOTW on the Switch for around a week now; clocking up a whopping thirty-five plus hours tackling the main quest lines and a number of side activities., neg,0.6
There is however an awful lot more of the game left to play - more on that later., neg,1
The story is typical fantasy adventure fodder but that is by no means a negative., pos,1
Enchanting; intriguing and seemingly taking some nods from older titles; the narrative is in our opinion a big improvement on previous Zelda efforts., neg,1
Over a hundred years ago the people of Hyrule lived in relative peace; the Sheikahas blue aura providing oodles of life to the lands; sadly though this peace was blown into chaos by the beast Calamity Ganon as he assaulted the lands., neg,1
Link; our hero; along with Princess Zelda attempted to stop the evil but failed., neg,1
As they tried and failed; the Sheikah in one last ditch attempt to destroy the vile monster awoke a secretly made army of machines known as Guardians along with four divine beasts., neg,1
In the final battle our heroes managed to seal Calamity Ganon inside Hyrule Castle with one key side effect - the mechanical army awoken to save Hyrule was turned against it., neg,1
In panic., neg,1
The King banished the Sheikah from the land., neg,1
Having played numerous RPGs over many years; its tough to think of one that is as spellbinding and so moreish as this., pos,1
A modern day marvel on the Nintendo Switch; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is simply stunning., pos,1
Breath of the Wild is the complete revolution of The Legend of Zelda series I never knew I always wanted., neg,1
Nintendo has broken away from the shackles of its prestigious history and crafted the modern action-RPG we never thought Zelda would become., pos,1
It's a disservice to simply label it spectacular; and must buy as a Switch launch title is merely a formality., pos,1
Nintendo promised a lot and left us hanging delay after delay; culminating in a cross-gen farewell doubling as an introduction; but it's delivered in every sense of the word., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is the best in a series that's scarcely disappointed., pos,0.6
Everything has changed., neg,1
On the surface; Breath of the Wild resembles and captures the essence of The Legend of Zelda., neg,1
But unlike those that came before it; stepping into the shoes of this incarnation of Link isn't like riding a bike; it demands veteran fans relearn how to play., neg,0.6
After a short instruction; BOTW thrusts you into a vast world that at first glance appears restrictive; but is actually wide open., pos,1
There's little direction; and after graduating from the tutorial segment; you're left entirely up to your own devices to uncover the unconventional structure., neg,1
The new quest-based design is lifted straight from every JRPG ever made; but they don't combine the nuance and frankly brilliance of Zelda's iconic dungeon design with delightful combat., neg,0.8
The rulebook has been entirely rewritten to allow players to approach main and side quests at their discretion; and yet there's never a wavering of Zelda's core identity - and yes; you can choose to skip the core 40 hours and run straight to fight Ganon; if you dare., neg,1
It'd be extremely foolish; but even having the option adorn the Adventure Log resonates Nintendo's dedication to the drastic overhaul., neg,1
The refreshed mechanics aren't anything revolutionary in isolation., pos,1
The inclusion of a jump button; the ability to climb; relying upon many melee and ranged weapons; a selection of dashing trousers; RPG-style stats and cooking food to restore XP have all been done before., neg,1
But inject them into an open world rendition of Hyrule; and they transcend their apparent simplicity., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is by far the hardest Zelda game; certainly amongst the 3D console games; and putting nostalgia aside; it's a fair assessment to say overall., neg,1
While I enjoyed replaying Ocarina of Time; Majora's Mask; The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess in their 3DS and Wii U remasters; the similarities between them are immense; with prior experience; you're going through the motions., pos,1
Joyful motions; but there's nothing there you haven't seen before., neg,1
Breath of the Wild demands genuine respect., pos,1
Not quite in the sense of Dark Souls' brutal repercussions; you don't lose anything for dying; but it will punish you for taking a lackadaisical approach and constantly remind you who's boss., pos,1
Expect to die in this Zelda game; expect to fail; and it will always be your fault for being careless or underprepared., neg,1
The predictable formula of finding items mid-dungeon; often making older items redundant; towards a charge to fight Ganon has been wiped clean., neg,1
All the tools you need to complete Breath of the Wild are made available within the opening hour; which is the only segment that features a semblance of handholding., neg,1
From the outset; Link has access to a range of shields; swords; spears and axes - anything that can be used to whack enemies; really - plus bows and arrows., neg,1
After a dash of narrative; he unlocks four core abilities; and gains a hang glider to make traversing the enormous environment palatable., pos,1
Those abilities begin with the self-explanatory Remote Bomb., neg,1
Magnesis; which allows Link to manipulate selected objects; and Stasis; which freezes time on one selected object and enables kinetic energy to push it in a desired direction; immediately join the selection., pos,0.6
Cryonis; which generates climbable; ice platforms from bodies of water; rounds out Link's mandatory repertoire., neg,1
Of course; all of these can be enhanced; but you'll have to seek out the opportunities., neg,1
Barely anything in Breath of the Wild falls into your lap., neg,1
Having to deal with items constantly breaking takes some acclimatising; but once you've accepted the change; it evolves combat without detracting from its Z-targeting DNA., neg,1
The customisation of assigning items to action buttons has been relegated to the history books., neg,1
The D-Pad is given the task of cycling between melee weapons; of which Link now has many to choose from; and the Z buttons are used to aim and fire his range weapon., neg,1
You'll still lock onto enemies and either slash or shoot at them (or their giant eye); but limited durability forces you to adopt a variety of tactics., neg,1
You won't always have a sword to partner your shield; at least not a powerful one; so are forced to experiment with heavy two-handed weapons and the reach of long spears., neg,1
What begins as a cycling by necessity; because the earliest weapons are feeble and break quickly; becomes second nature., neg,1
This has allowed Nintendo to rethink combat., neg,1
Enemies no longer generate in predetermined patterns around the world., neg,0.8
Instead they converge in small groups with strength in numbers., pos,1
While some are stationed as lookouts; others will rest and some will have laid down their weapons to huddle by a campfire; giving Link an opportune moment to strike., neg,1
There's more variety in both types and the ability of foes; and many of them are aided by the changing weather conditions., neg,0.6
As usual; deadlier enemies lurk at night; but some also benefit from electrically charged thunder storms; extreme heat or rainy conditions through Breath of the Wild's dynamic weather., neg,0.8
Having to cook elixirs and health packs sounds tedious; but it quickly assimilates and encourages exploring off the beaten path to stockpile rare inventory., neg,1
I don't normally bother with crafting potions or memorising ingredients in games if I can avoid it; I can't really be bothered cooking in real life; but it's actually enticing in Breath of the Wild., pos,0.6
To be honest; I ignored it for about five hours; before finding how easy it is to toss a couple of items together to improve their effectiveness., pos,1
Without any hearts hiding in tall grass or commoners' pots; Link has to eat to replenish his health; but chowing down on apples and mushrooms will only get you so far., neg,1
I eventually investigated the culinary arts; not for health; but the stats boosts., neg,1
While stronger enemies are a deterrence entering for some areas; Hyrule's regions attempt to keep you at bay through the elements., neg,1
Fire can keep you warm in the snow; but potions are much more effective at allowing Link to safely roam the extreme temperatures when he's not yet dressed for the climate., pos,1
They can also be used to improve his speed or enhance his defences against certain attacks; which proves extremely handy against flying electric buggers., pos,1
Crafting food and potions is a winner in BOTW because it actually serves a purpose., neg,1
It's off-putting by nature; but as soon as you venture beyond that mindset; you're instantly rewarded and encouraged to try more., neg,1
Quirky items goes hand-in-hand with exploration., neg,1
Breath of the Wild wants you to explore its diverse landscape; and climb up as many cliff faces as possible., pos,1
I got lost for hours wandering around areas that had nothing to do with any of my active main quests., neg,0.8
I found a bunch of side quests; which are easily distinguished and totally optional; and some handy valuable loot I sold for a high price., pos,0.8
Not all the trinkets; fancy materials and monster parts are used for dinner -- it's the easiest way to acquire Rupees; which are harder to come by; and thus actually prosper a monetary value., neg,1
Link finally starts his quest with an appropriately sized wallet; and he needs it., neg,0.8
Items are expensive in Hyrule; Rupees aren't that easy to come by; and you'll actually need to buy things., neg,1
Zelda finally has a meaningful economy that makes you think twice before spending big., pos,1
All this is tiring work for our pointy-eared champion of legends; who is now dependent on a stamina meter; which means he can actually sprint., neg,1
No more rolling around under the illusion of a speed boost., neg,1
But it doesn't last long., neg,1
Until it's been substantially upgraded; sprinting has to be confined to short bursts., neg,1
The stamina meter is also used to fuel Link's newfound athleticism to climb walls; trees and mountains with muscular prowess., neg,1
It's a restriction that ensures Link doesn't morph into Nathan Drake; but allows unprecedented scope to explore newfound heights; which would otherwise be inaccessible., pos,1
Naturally Epona; Link's faithful horse; makes an appearance; plus he learns how to ride a few more creatures., neg,1
But the easiest way to get around is through a combination of climbing and hand gliding., neg,1
Incoming Zelda mechanics have often been confined by a strict timer; which is what makes the brilliant puzzles work., pos,1
While climbing has become fashionable amongst action games; Breath of the Wild ensures it still behaves like a Zelda mechanic., neg,1
But you do spend a lot of time staring at a rapidly depleting circular stamina meter in the middle of the screen; clinging to hope there's enough remaining to reach the top of a cliff (there normally isn't)., pos,0.6
The wisdom of this overhauled items system is it enables players to explore the uncharted map with total independence., neg,1
You'll know when you waltz into an area sooner than you should - enemies will destroy you in one fell swoop - and others try and keep you at bay with extreme hot or cold temperatures; but these are all problems that can be solved; or avoided; whenever you like., neg,1
There are optional shrines scattered through the land; which act as mini-dungeons utilising Link's four core abilities., neg,1
These reward you with spirit orbs; which can be exchanged for new heart or stamina containers., neg,0.8
By removing the shackles of linear item upgrades; they can be discovered and completed in any order., pos,1
The puzzles are true to the exceptional quality we expect from Eiji Aonuma's Zelda team., pos,1
Almost all are fun to figure out; and provide the illusive sense of ingenuity when you arrive at the logical conclusion; which so many games struggle to provide., pos,1
My only fault with the puzzle and dungeon design in Breath of the Wild; both shrines and full size dungeons; is the mandatory motion control puzzles., neg,1
As you would expect; these suck; and are clearly a relic from the Wii U GamePad origins., neg,1
Trying to manoeuvre a ball through a maze is painful using the motion sensing capabilities of the Pro Controller; for which they clearly weren't designed., neg,1
It's a little better using the Switch in handheld mode; but then the screen you're trying to look at is purposely pushed outside your field of vision., neg,1
There is no option to control these using a control stick; but fortunately they're irregular; and the other motion controls; used for aiming; can be disabled entirely., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is a gorgeous game to behold; but it's a cross-gen one., pos,1
Even playing on Switch; it feels like a game pushing hardware to its limitations at the end of its life., neg,1
The vibrant art style is stunning to behold on the Switch's fantastic 720p screen; and it's how Breath of the Wild is best played., pos,1
Bumped to 900p when docked to a TV; it's clear why Nintendo couldn't get it running at the preferred 1080p., neg,1
Sprinting through tall grass and rain; there are noticeable frame rate drops in TV mode; whereas Breath of the Wild runs smoothly during the same sections in handheld mode., pos,1
In fact; I never noticed any slowdown when playing in handheld mode., neg,1
While the scope of Breath of the Wild; and its pretty art style; deserve to be witnessed on a big screen TV with the added comfort of a Pro Controller; there's no doubt this was always intended to be a 720p game; and is perhaps a sign Switch hardware mightn't be capable of running intensive games in full HD., pos,0.8
Simply put; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the best launch title I've ever played., pos,1
It's captivated me more than any game with a system launch; and it's rocketed straight into number one on my all-time favourite Zelda games., neg,1
You could play it on Wii U; where it's still a fantastic game -- clearly the best on the console., pos,1
But it's that little bit more special to have such an amazing; massive game on a handheld system., pos,1
Wherever you play; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was worth the wait., pos,1
There has never been a small Legend of Zelda game., pos,1
Since the series' start in 1986; instant classics like Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past have been universally acclaimed as some of the greatest achievements in the medium., neg,1
Even seemingly inconsequential handheld entries pushed innovative control schemes and cooperative multiplayer that changed fan's understanding of Zelda's core mechanics., neg,1
And now; after years of development and delays; the latest entry in the iconic series has finally arrived in the form of another franchise first: an expansive open world., pos,1
In many ways; Breath of the Wild is the biggest Zelda game of all time., neg,1
Following the tepid reception of the Wii U; this game arrives as the herald of Nintendo's new system; the Switch., neg,1
This title dominates the launch lineup of the portable hybrid console; signaling the end of the Wii U era as well as the potential of the new machine., neg,1
This time around; Hyrule itself is free of any boundaries; inviting players to an open-ended quest that simultaneously flips the idea of what it means to be a Zelda game on its head while telling an emotionally resonant tale within the 30-year-old canon., pos,1
Many games that offer massive; detailed maps tout the ability to blaze your own path; but player's ability to interact with the world has never felt less confined than it does here., pos,1
From the moment Link jumps off the elevated plateau serving as Breath of the Wild's disguised tutorial; every move forward is completely reliant on the player's instincts., neg,1
The sensation of freedom starts slowly; as you learn to forage the environment for new weapons and ingredients to survive combat with smaller enemies; building to teachable moments of failure., neg,0.8
Succumbing to the harsh conditions of a frigid mountain peak or engaging creatures that crush you in one hit are frustrating mistakes; but the opportunity to experiment within the world opens the door for a better understanding of the underlying systems., pos,1
Each and every impulse you may have while exploring Hyrule is respected and rewarded., neg,1
Treasure chests with powerful weapons are hidden within caves and high up on cliffs; and the layer of side quests to complete almost never ceases., pos,0.8
Before turning over full control; a short list of things that should be done eventually is presented; but never once does it impede you from steering the journey in another direction., neg,1
It would be easy to feel overwhelmed by the endless procession of collectible components; but just as easy to lose a dozen hours traveling between intersecting country roads and climbing high enough to enjoy every gorgeous vista., neg,1
Distractions are common in Breath of the Wild; naturally motivating the player to go and see something brand new., pos,0.6
Randomly occurring enemy behavior and weather patterns ensure that every player has a different experience within the game., neg,0.6
You may hold off on exploring a certain location because of your current equipment; but drinking the right elixir or simply approaching from a different direction allows the discovery of something unseen., pos,1
Previous Zelda games offered a similar illusion of choice when finding important items and filing sidequests; but maintained linearity when it came to the main draw of temples and dungeons., neg,1
The latest entry preserves the puzzle-solving challenges of its predecessors; but presents them in a brand new way., neg,0.8
There are more than 100 shrines scattered around; offering a single slice of the traditional platforming puzzles that rely on Link's special abilities and the player's intuition., neg,1
Shrines are sometimes surrounded by combat challenges and environmental barriers that have to be solved before access is given., neg,1
They serve as fast-travel beacons after they're cleared., neg,1
Characters encountered at villages can point you toward some of the more mysterious locations; and occasionally you might stumble into situations that reveal a new layer of intrigue; but almost every development depends on your capacity for curiosity., pos,0.6
A Studio Ghibli-inspired art style makes for gorgeous presentation that carries over to small environmental details and memorable characters' facial animations., pos,0.8
For the first time; important characters are given spoken dialogue with full voice acting., pos,1
Initially; it is surprising to hear Zora and Gorons speaking out loud; but most of the long speeches are saved for key story moments; adding gravitas to the hefty narrative., neg,1
Players are tasked with deciding in what order they want to tackle the storyline; or even if at all; before rushing toward the final boss., neg,1
With such a relaxed approach to progression; it may seem at first that the narrative has taken a backseat to polished gameplay., pos,1
However; the story told in Breath of the Wild takes a unique risk that pays off within the context of the most open-ended Zelda game yet., pos,1
There are many questions presented in the opening hours; and the answers rely on you stumbling across the vague clues hidden around Hyrule., neg,1
Breath of the Wild's only tangible constraint is how creative the player can be at any given moment., neg,0.8
The game is genuinely challenging; with secrets and rewards to be found around every corner., pos,1
As you play; the staggering amount of ways in which you can interact with Hyrule naturally reveal themselves., neg,1
There is always something new to discover; but at your own pace., neg,1
Somehow; the adventure never loses momentum over dozens of hours of exploration; the inspired design holds up; making for an unmistakable Zelda game that completely changes everything expected from the series., pos,1
After spending so much time with Breath of the Wild; it is already hard to imagine going back to the antiquated presentation of the past., neg,1
For many years; Nintendo simply didn't know what people wanted out of a Zelda game., neg,1
Originally Wind Waker was going to feature a traditional realistic art style; but the creators got worried that in the increasingly competitive market they wouldn't stand out -- so Toon Link was born., pos,1
It sold well but many fans reacted negatively to it at the time; causing them to shift back into realism with Twilight Princess; which; subsequently; people also didn't like; having finally come around to Wind Waker., neg,0.8
To some degree Skyward Sword tried to marry the two styles; but The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild rights so many of the wrongs that game committed., pos,1
My relationship with the Zelda series is public record., neg,0.8
The original was one of my first adventure games outside of Dragon Warrior; and subsequently; each release has bookended a specific point of my life., pos,1
Yet; I don't care for a number of games in the franchise; especially the last two mainline Zeldas: Link Between Worlds and Skyward Sword., neg,1
It's a weird relationship; I know; and it's why I was so surprised that Breath of the Wild walks back a lot of the boring or bad strides respectively that the series has made lately., neg,1
There's a much bigger emphasis on your emotional connection to the world of Wild., neg,1
It embraces the timeline theory without being held hostage to it; or being too tongue-in-cheek and meta about it., pos,1
Wild has some depressing moments that fit and accent the level of desperation that usually comes with being the Hero of Hyrule., neg,1
Voice acting assists this emotional angle; and no; it's not overdone., neg,0.8
There's still plenty of hooos and haaahs; when speaking to NPCs -- that adorable gibberish talk is alive and well., pos,1
Thematically; the effort to turn it into a far future-type Zelda while still remaining true to the adventurous medieval roots is admirable., pos,1
As more threads start to unravel; the narrative never feels overbearing and doesn't overstay its welcome., neg,1
I can't tell you how many times other games have done this; where it feels like I'm stuck in one boring town or area while folks barricade the gate and yell you can't leave yet; your business isn't finished!, neg,1
Which leads me to Breath of the Wild's most paramount virtue: freedom., neg,0.6
While the first hour (or much less if you know what you're doing) is technically a tutorial zone of sorts; you're given a gigantic land mass to play around in; where the game proceeds to hand out most of your abilities -- then sends you on your merry way to the true open world with no strings attached., pos,0.6
It beats the crap out of wrestling farm animals for an hour., neg,1
Wait; what?, neg,1
Most of your abilities?, neg,1
Yep., neg,1
I know what you're thinking., neg,1
What about the tried-and-true Zelda formula where you enter x dungeon and get x item?, neg,1
Well; that's thankfully gone; as much as I've enjoyed it in the past., pos,1
A Link Between Worlds dabbled in this concept with item renting; but Breath of the Wild blows the doors off that idea with an amplifier that goes to 11; jumps off the stage; and crowd surfs., neg,1
You do accrue mostly combat spells of sorts from clearing each core dungeon (there's four; with an optional fifth that grants no powers); but for the most part; you're equipped with the following Runes -- two different kinds of bombs (round and cubed); a glider; stasis; a giant magnet; a camera; an amiibo summoner; and a spell that creates blocks of ice in water -- all governed by a cooldown timer., neg,0.6
While I won't spoil how all of these spells work; suffice to say there are multiple uses for them; and new scenarios that Breath of the Wild keeps chucking at you at a rapid pace., pos,0.8
Even if you think you know how bombs have worked (or have always operated within the confines of the series); there's usually a surprise waiting for you at the next shrine (read: small challenge rooms littered about the overworld)., neg,0.6
Initially; I felt underwhelmed that Nintendo went this route., pos,0.6
I kept thinking that I had missed a few abilities early on; as I would enter shrines and have no conceivable way of completing them., neg,1
But I was wrong., neg,1
Hours later I entered my first dungeon; and was able to use an item I had picked up in the first 15 minutes to solve a puzzle in a way I didn't even think to try previously., pos,1
I went back to that pesky shrine and cleared it with a smile on my face., pos,1
This is how open world games should work., pos,1
Not with and overabundance of checklists and millions of map icons to clear for achievement points -- but with a design that feels legitimately interconnected and fluid in an all-encompassing way., pos,1
Breath of the Wild isn't just open in the sense that you can roam around., pos,1
It has more RPG elements than any game in the series; with a litany of gear and items to find., neg,1
The scale is so massive that over 60 hours in; I'm still discovering new ingredients to cook with items I've never seen before., pos,0.6
With a dedicated jump button (hi Adventure of Link) you can climb up just about any mountain and leap off the top (one of my favorite pastimes)., pos,1
Seeing fast travel and radio towers come to a Nintendo game is a little weird; but they own it; and naturally; are host to their own little puzzles., neg,1
Nothing; even the few borrowed concepts; are half-measures., neg,1
It's hard to convey just how free Breath of the Wild feels on paper., neg,1
Once I spent half an hour chopping down trees; and I had no idea what I could even use the wood for., neg,1
I pulled out a real pen and paper and jotted down recipes I had discovered; and experimented for another 30 minutes to find the perfect concoction., pos,1
I pulled up the in-game map and stamped areas I wanted to return to later; even if they weren't hosting any specific quest or reward., pos,1
Many times I entered an area by way of an alternative puzzle solution; and not the primary method the designers perhaps intended for me., pos,1
The dungeons; which I suspect will be a point of contention from folks who want everything to stay the same (I can see the thinkpieces in my head); also encapsulate this philosophy., neg,1
They're much more compact; and are almost exclusively based on puzzle-solving outside of the final encounter., pos,1
There's no bide time until you get the hookshot and then use it to solve every puzzle the rest of the dungeon formula -- you're using everything you picked up at the start; which includes the aforementioned multi-use array of puzzle-solving tools., neg,1
Fi isn't there to ruin the solution., neg,1
There's no forced tutorial section directly after you defeat a miniboss and pick up the new dungeon item., neg,1
The dungeons feel like an extension of the open world itself; as do the shrines., pos,0.8
Everything funnels back into every other aspect of Breath of the Wild in a deliberate fashion., neg,1
You aren't just earning new Heart Containers or pieces of loot; you're acquiring knowledge., neg,0.8
By the end of the game I felt like a superhero; and traveled across the world in search of shrines to complete., neg,1
A world; mind; that's mostly stable., neg,1
There are some framerate drops; even on TV mode; in several areas., neg,1
I have a feeling people are going to be up in arms about it; but for me it didn't occur often enough to truly have an impact on my fun., pos,1
That's because I care more about the draw distance honestly; which is so well done that it hits that chord of I see that place in the distance; and want to go there more than any game I've ever played., neg,1
While towers are usually just throwaway bits that unlock more map icons; I would frequently revisit them just to scout for new places to explore for the heck of it., neg,1
Combat is also simple enough where you aren't worrying about iFrames or precise rolling; so the occasional dip isn't as crippling as; say; a pure action game., pos,1
Motion controls for projectile aiming are also incredibly precise; and best of all -- optional., pos,1
There's some semblance of the advancements made on the Wii and Wii U; but they're not forced., neg,1
I love it!, pos,0.8
I thought I would hate juggling items with the new durability system; but it's fun to try all the different types of weapons., pos,1
Much like the game's puzzles you can approach combat in multiple ways; with stealth or item-based solutions; and the choice to wield an axe; staff; one-handed sword; magic wand; boomerang; or a bow play into that., pos,1
I thought the Joy-Con Grip (which is basically two Joy-Con controllers slotted together) would feel underwhelming too; but I got used to it in less than an hour., neg,1
Equipment selection is handled with the sectioned d-pad like C-Buttons; and the motion controls work great., pos,0.6
As an aside I did not have access to a Pro Controller for this review; but will have one going forward after I buy one when the game officially launches., neg,1
By the time the credits rolled (and I was back outside of the final fight with a star next to my save file; New Game+ style); I was about 40 hours deep., pos,0.8
But there's over 100 shrines to find; several superbosses to fight; hidden gear to locate; and optional mini-questlines; so I'm going to be busy for a while longer., neg,1
Speaking of extras -- in case you're wondering; the amiibo support is mostly harmless., neg,1
You get some extra items you can otherwise find in the game; or some Easter egg type stuff that isn't overpowered (you can find armor in the first few hours that is better than most of the figure boosts)., neg,0.8
The Wolf Link companion does feel like a massive thing in the form of a bite-sized paid piece of DLC; but I don't feel like it was necessarily cut., neg,1
A massive 100 hour or more adventure makes this choice easier to digest., pos,0.8
If the figures were scarce I'd be angry; but they're widely available., pos,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has very little wrong with it., neg,1
There's the occasional framerate drop; a short stealth sequence; another short escort bit; and a few bosses that are fine; but aren't as memorable as they should be., pos,1
They're going to be the main talking points as folks break the game down over the course of the next year (and decade)., neg,1
But those moments were quickly erased from my mind given the rapid-fire pacing and promise of returning to the sprawling universe., pos,1
I flipped dungeons 360 degrees and walked on their ceilings; and never once was frustrated., neg,0.8
I found an island where a deity stripped me of my items and challenged me to solve various riddles so I could get my gear back., neg,1
I fought optional world bosses; explored labyrinths far off the beaten path; and gradually learned how to tame horses -- none of which are handed to you on a silver platter., neg,1
This isn't your typical boiler plate open world cash grab; rife with to-do lists and busywork., pos,1
Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an evolution of the formula for both eastern and western philosophies alike; and a new blueprint., pos,1
It isn't perfect; since nothing is; but came as close as you could get in a given genre., pos,1
The new leader to beat., neg,0.8
Sorry; Ocarina of Time; you've been dethroned., neg,1
Roughly four hours into The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; the long-awaited latest instalment in Nintendo's flagship action-adventure franchise - and the Switch's premier launch title - we find ourselves in a lush forest scurrying up the trunk of an apple tree., pos,0.8
As the game's princess-rescuing protagonist Link; we quickly fall to the tree's foot with no fruit to show for our efforts., neg,1
As we psyche ourselves up for a second go at the prized produce; a group of club-wielding Bokoblins approach., pos,0.6
Without warning; the pig-faced foes - one of the series' signature enemies since 2003's The Wind Waker - attack our already down-on-his-luck hero., neg,1
Surprised and a bit frantic; we break out a rusty axe we'd picked up earlier and begin wildly swinging at the aggressive attackers., neg,1
Our initial swipes don't connect with the creatures; but do manage to carve a few meaty chunks from the tree's base., neg,1
When our brains finally catch up to our twitchy fingers; we discover we've not only beaten the beasts by taking cover behind the downed tree's trunk; but also brought the apples to a level where they can be easily looted., neg,1
The pulse-quickening encounter isn't part of any story mission or some side quest granted by a needy villager incapable of picking their own fruit., neg,0.6
It's just something that happened while we were walking through the woods., neg,1
In addition to an armload of apples; we left the forest with an almost daunting sense of discovery; if an innocent stroll can quickly escalate into a tooth-and-nail battle; what else is possible on our path to saving the princess and freeing the kingdom of Hyrule from the tightening clutches of returning evil-doer Ganon?, neg,1
., neg,1
As it turns out; pretty much anything and everything can happen in Breath of the Wild., neg,1
If you're a faithful fan; you've probably heard plenty about its new features; from its open-world and degradable weapons to its cooking system and survival-focused gameplay., pos,1
Much more than back-of-the-box bullet points; though., neg,1
these fresh additions (and others we won't spoil for you) are integral; interconnected parts that seamlessly work together; while also fitting snugly into the franchise's more comfortably familiar elements., pos,1
none of the new tweaks feel like game-ified mechanics; but rather natural threads organically woven into the fabric of a sprawling sandbox adventure., pos,1
Beneath the surface of our seemingly simple fight for a few pieces of fruit; there hide elements stealthily feeding into these new features., neg,0.6
The battle left our old axe nearly broken; but also presented us with new melee weapons in the fallen Bokolins' clubs; the apples could be consumed on their own for a quick health boost; but might better serve us when paired with other cooking ingredients., neg,1
Of course; we also could have chopped up the trunk of the fallen tree to create a bundle of wood; which then could have been ignited by striking a metal object against a flint., pos,0.8
but we're getting ahead of ourselves., neg,1
Even after making such dynamic discoveries; Breath of the Wild continued to surprise us with unexpected interactions; emergent encounters; and magical moments that harked back to a time when being fully immersed in a Zelda game meant being tethered to a NES., pos,1
It wasn't until several hours or so in; for example; that we realised shooting a mountain goat with a flaming arrow would result in a delicious seared steak; or that Link - who's capable of scaling Hyrule's most treacherous mountains - could slip up when attempting to climb a tiny village shack that's just been slicked with rain., pos,1
Speaking of Mother Nature's ability to impede your progress; Breath of the Wild's changing weather and varied climates could also see Link cosied up to one of those aforementioned impromptu campfires or stripping off his tunic to fend off heat stroke., pos,0.8
Mix the right ingredients over an open flame; though; and you just might be able to combat the elements; as well as other threats; with a magic elixir; hearty meal or potion made from the less savoury parts of your fallen foes., pos,1
Players will also need to manage Link's stamina; as running out of steam during activities like swimming; paragliding and climbing can result in deaths unbefitting Hyrule's legendary hero., neg,1
There's nothing more embarrassing than not being able to save the princess because you got tired while taking a dip in the pond., neg,1
Thankfully; the right recipe or piece of gear can also help defend against such unceremonious ends., neg,0.6
Worrying about Link getting winded or stressing over whether or not an Octorok Tentacle will spoil your stew may sound like the sort of thing you'd do in a hardcore survival simulation., neg,0.6
But these welcome evolutions to the series' tried-and-true template are accessible additions that complement; rather than complicate; what we already love about these games., pos,1
More importantly; Breath of the Wild is still very much a traditional Zelda adventure at its heart., pos,0.6
Smart puzzles; dungeon-dwelling bosses; charming characters and imaginative storytelling are still on the agenda., pos,1
In fact; thanks to inspired new powers spawned from the mysterious Sheika Slate; puzzle-filled Shrines; brilliantly crafted enemy encounters and a beautiful world brimming with life; the game's more familiar beats are better than ever., pos,1
Breath of the Wild will be called a lot of things; from a Nintendo Switch system-seller to a shoe-in for 2017's game of the year., neg,1
But such lofty praise doesn't do it justice., pos,0.6
Link's latest adventure is not only his absolute best to date; it's a masterpiece the interactive medium will be forever influenced by., pos,1
Summary: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a beautiful return to the Zelda universe that succeeds on every level on the Nintendo Switch!, pos,1
The highly anticipated The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has arrived on the Nintendo Wii U and is also a launch title for their new console; the Switch (reviewed) and in my opinion is one of the best Zelda games in the entire series., pos,0.6
Like Final Fantasy; Zelda has a huge following from around the world and even the late great Robin Williams named his daughter after the princess from this series., pos,1
The hero of the game is of course the legendary Link; an adventurer who has awoken from a magical sleep after 100 years., neg,1
Unfortunately for hero; he has no recollection of who or where he is but is guided by a mysterious female voice and a strange old man., pos,1
However as the game progresses; we soon discover that a creature called the Calamity Ganon almost destroyed the world 100 years ago which nearly resulted in the death of Link., neg,1
However the courageous Princess Zelda has kept this nefarious beast at bay for the last century but regrettably her powers are failing., neg,0.6
As a result; the destructive force of Ganon is engulfing its poison over the lands of Hyrule again and it's up to Link and Zelda to finally end this threat., neg,1
At its core; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an open world action adventure with elements of RPG and crafting thrown into the mix., pos,1
Compared to its predecessors; this game offers the player a plethora of challenges and clever gameplay mechanics to really immerse you into this title., neg,1
Even from the very first moments that Link wakes from his 100-year slumber to meeting the mysterious old man who serves as your guide and the first time you survey your majestic surroundings; it's simply quite stunning from start to finish., pos,1
Best of all; Breath of the Wild is a very dynamic experience and the creators ensure that there are multiple paths to be taken and different ways to solve your puzzles and quests., pos,0.8
Link also has access to an ancient item called the Sheikah Slate which allows him to access devices in the game and shrines which is not only a progression tool but has other useful abilities like using it as a binocular or setting waypoints on the map., pos,0.6
Ironically this device looks very reminiscent of a Nintendo Switch plus it supports the gyroscope to use for puzzles and even using it in the real world to observe the in-game environment from a first person perspective or taking photos in the game., pos,1
Furthermore; magic does play a key part of the game with our adventurer having access to a handful of spells through the Sheikah Slate that allows him to manipulate items in the gaming environment., pos,1
For example; one of these powers is a magnet that allows Link to move items made from metal or another that stops time., neg,1
Furthermore; the Shrines in Zelda not only serve as a teleportation point for quick travel but also as a puzzle in order to get orbs which allow Link to power-up., neg,1
These puzzles generally require you to use your abilities to manipulate items within the shrine such as freezing water to be able to access a floating ball and then using your magnetic powers in order to move the ball with a large metal dish to access a trigger., pos,1
In terms of solutions; most of the puzzles do require you to think but the solution is always right in front of you and in more ways than one., pos,0.8
Although you start the game with no memories of your previous life; you soon start to receive a string of breadcrumb clues that help you piece together what exactly happened and what is your role one century later., neg,0.6
So as you awake from the resurrection shrine; you only have your underwear to explore the world but before you venture out; you do find a shirt and pants and then further along the way a weapon and even a shield., neg,1
It should be noted that the controls on the Nintendo Switch work exceptionally well and the game plays really well on both the TV or just on the console itself which I preferred more; especially when you had a pair of headphones connected to it., neg,1
So as you explore and defeat enemies; you will be rewarded with additional equipment; items and weapons to help in your quest., pos,1
This includes a variety of weapons from swords to spears and your trusty bow to even weirder weapons like monster arms and even sticks., neg,0.6
When it comes to weapons however; these only have a set number of hits before they become useless which adds to the overall strategy of combat., neg,1
Armour plays an important part to protecting your character while fighting; however if you are not dressed appropriately and as an example; some areas in the game will kill you faster due to the cold and you can even tailor your clothes., neg,1
Thankfully there are fires to help warm your character and rest; including the ability of cooking a variety of foods to restore your health and give you other bonuses., pos,1
Navigating a Zelda game has never been more enjoyable than Breath of the Wild because you can virtually explore every nook and cranny of this massive open-world game., pos,1
So whether you're climbing cliffs or even trees; this allows for some additional excitement to be found., pos,1
With that said; you do have a stamina bar when climbing and if you don't have a place to rest like an edge on a cliff; you may find yourself falling to your death., neg,1
Stamina is also used for running so there's a good balance to be found in the game while you explore but plenty of power-ups and bonuses to assist., neg,0.8
Although the game offers fast travel to certain areas; Link has access to a glider thanks to the mysterious old man which allows you to fly around the gaming world and is quite exhilarating with a touch of vertigo., pos,1
Compared to some other open-world games; Zelda Breath of the Wild brings another element that some of these other titles don't do as well., neg,1
This is unpredictability in its nature and although the game does start relatively straight forward; the developers throw in some very random elements., neg,1
For example; I remember using my paraglider to get over a precarious valley with sheer drops on both sides and although I managed to successfully get to the other side; it started to rain., neg,1
This meant that I was stuck on a ledge and although Link or as another amusing character calls him 'Linky' can climb; this is impossible when it's raining., neg,0.8
To compound the situation; a massive storm was headed in my direction which meant I was stuck and all I could do was wait it out., neg,0.6
So without spoiling any of the surprises or encounters in the game; Breath of the Wild is filled with them which makes the gameplay quite unpredictable and very dynamic., pos,0.6
Combat is really fun in the game that offers both melee and ranged attacks., pos,1
When it comes to enemies; they are quite diverse in the game and as you progress; they do become more powerful and quite dangerous towards Link., pos,1
Some are so powerful; they can kill in just one hit., pos,1
Given that; there is an element of grinding but because the world is so interactive and enjoyable; this is not really a chore because of how fun the exploring is., pos,1
One cool aspect about Breath of the Wild is using the environment to take out enemies like pushing giant rocks or snowballs at enemies; cutting down trees and even throwing things at them., neg,1
So while you're exploring the world; you meet a wide assortment of characters who will give you quests and also the ability to purchase their wares., pos,1
If you do get stuck; you can check out the Adventure Log which neatly puts a waypoint on your map., neg,1
Graphically; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is quite stunning on the Nintendo Switch and looks amazing on both the TV and the tablet mode with some great attention to detail., pos,1
Characters have this cell-shaded look to them and move well with the gaming environment with some good textures., pos,0.6
However where the Breath of the Wild shines is through the gaming world of Hyrule that is one of the most lush and rich environments to grace this series., pos,1
The weather effects in the game are also to die for; especially the vicious storms with its lightning and realistic clouds and rain., neg,1
At times; I could almost feel the pain on Link as he attempted to get through these crazy storms., neg,1
So whether it's the realistic transition from day to night; the excellent reflections on the water; how the foliage moves or the little subtleties such as the fireflies or how Link interacts with this world; it's pretty much perfect in every sense., pos,1
The draw distance also gets the thumbs up as well!, pos,1
Furthermore; the audio goes hand in hand with the both the gameplay and the graphics with a Zelda inspired soundtrack; good sound effects and some decent voice acting when used., neg,0.6
The only slight negative is that I wish the game contained more voice work when you talk with other NPC's but thankfully the text is relatively quick and to the point., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is one of the best Zelda games to date and it's also the perfect game for the Nintendo Switch due to its portability., pos,1
It's a very well-crafted game with some wonderful gaming mechanics and nothing feels contrived or limited but rather; it creates a very engaging open-world experience and one that feels real on so many levels., neg,0.6
So if you're looking for a reason to buy a Switch; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is almost the only reason you need., neg,1
As I've kept spoilers to a bare minimum; the only other advice I would give is that do not rush playing this game; explore every area because it will make the experience a much more powerful one., pos,1
Sure; some gamers have finished this title in a handful of hours but like any good relationship; give it plenty of time!, neg,0.6
Explore the wilds of Hyrule any way you like - Climb up towers and mountain peaks in search of new destinations; then set your own path to get there and plunge into the wilderness., neg,1
Along the way; you'll battle towering enemies; hunt wild beasts and gather ingredients for the food and elixirs you'll need to sustain you on your journey., neg,1
More than 100 Shrines of Trials to discover and explore - Shrines dot the landscape; waiting to be discovered in any order you want., neg,1
Search for them in various ways; and solve a variety of puzzles inside., neg,1
Work your way through the traps and devices inside to earn special items and other rewards that will help you on your adventure., pos,1
Be prepared and properly equipped - With an entire world waiting to be explored; you'll need a variety of outfits and gear to reach every corner., neg,1
You may need to bundle up with warmer clothes or change into something better suited to the desert heat., neg,1
Some clothing even has special effects that; for example; can make you faster and stealthier., neg,1
Battling enemies requires strategy - The world is inhabited with enemies of all shapes and sizes., neg,1
Each one has its own attack method and weaponry; so you must think quickly and develop the right strategies to defeat them., neg,0.8
I have never been a Zelda fan., neg,1
Before Breath of the Wild; I've never owned a copy of the game on any platform (nor have I ever beaten any significant portion of it)., neg,1
I have played some of the older ones in passing; but I'm talking pre-Gamecube era stuff as it's been that long since I've owned a Nintendo console., neg,1
What I'm trying to say is that I've never really spent much time with Link or the princess; and as such I'm coming at the series like a newbie - with no fan roots or nostalgia to draw on., neg,1
I tell you that now however; because I want you to know why you should trust me when I say that this is very easily one of the best games I've ever played., pos,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece; and if for some reason you need a primer before picking it up I'm here to lay it all out for you., pos,1
This is one game you don't want to miss; and it all starts with an amnesia-ridden champion that has been sleeping for a very long time., neg,1
As the game starts; our hero Link awakens in a special location somewhere in Hyrule., neg,0.8
Then - only moments after the game opens - you're given control and allowed to roam free., neg,1
It's here in this simple have at it moment  that your adventure begins; and it's right here in the first few moments of running around that you start to realize just how vast (in every sense of the word) this open world is., pos,1
Simply by looking around with your spyglass (a quick click of the left stick) you'll begin to notice that the sprawling land of Hyrule is not a free and prosperous place., neg,1
Instead; it's undergoing an all-out attack of gargantuan proportions as our ultimate enemy has infected the world with his sinister power., pos,0.8
For over a hundred years this enemy has controlled the powerful Divine Beasts which roam the land; and he regularly summons a blood moon to re-populate it with monsters., pos,1
Haunting Hyrule Castle; the bad-ass Calamity Gannon has nearly taken over; the only thing stopping him is the princess for which the game is named., neg,1
So without giving away anything past the premise; there lies your long term mission; fight Calamity Gannon; save Zelda; and restore the land to its final glory., neg,1
This mission - like most of the game - is yours to take on as you will; and you can rush there with four hearts and a tree branch if you like., neg,1
That said; I doubt that'll get you far without some champion-tier skills (or a miracle); but you have the option should you so choose!, neg,1
Instead; I recommend exploration - which should quickly yield some health-bestowing consumables; a (weak) weapon; a conversation with a non-player character; and a nice fire to sit beside and pass the time., neg,1
Abilities like cooking; paragliding; riding animals; and more will become apparent with a little (okay - sometimes a lot) of messing around; but the beauty of it all is that the game opens up as your own ingenuity and perseverance do., neg,1
Soon; you'll even realize that things in the world can have effects beyond what you expect at a glance., neg,1
You can light arrows or wooden weapons ablaze on a nearby fire for free burn damage; you can attract two enemies with different motivations and have them fight it out to the death; or you can even use the time-stop rune to make freezing effects last longer., neg,1
The world of Breath of the Wild is bound by a lot of the same rules you might expect from real world physics; so it's best to think like an action movie choreographer and use what you've got., neg,0.6
Likewise; it's good to keep an eye out for possibilities whenever you enter a new area., pos,0.6
Speaking of areas; the land you're free to explore is a large and complex place., pos,0.6
You'll find grassy fields; swampy marshes; sand-swept deserts; snow-covered mountains; and lava-filled pools on your travels - all of these places holding their own unique variations of enemies; habits; tactics; and collectibles., pos,1
You'll inevitably stumble across everything from lone enemies riding around on horseback; to giant area-roaming enemies; or even parties of monsters sleeping around a fire., neg,1
There are towns; ruins; towers; shrines; mazes; unique features; and stables all over - and it's your job to find and explore them all., pos,1
Learning through exploration is going to be the only way you'll be able to prepare for what comes next; and man is there a lot to see., neg,1
Aside from the geographical bits; the bits that are more looks than function; and the self explanatory bits; are the towns; towers; shrines; and stables., neg,0.6
These are the most prominent features on the map; and they're also some of the most important places in the game., pos,1
The towns are often home to shops., neg,1
These non-player character owned establishments usually include an armory; a general store; and an inn - but may also include a dye shop; a jeweler; a or various stands depending on the location., neg,1
Additionally; towns often include statues that you can pray to for additional hearts or stamina; cooking stations (a cauldron over a fire-pit) where you can combine ingredients into new items with new effects; and even some characters with missions for you to take on., pos,1
Towns are where it's happening a lot of the time; so keep an eye out for them., neg,1
As for towers; they're sort of like scouting locations., neg,1
Climbing them (which is often much easier said than done) will allow you to sync up and receive a piece of the map - but only the topography., neg,1
Towns; shrines; and other landmarks will not be noted on the map until visited; so be sure to head for them if you scout them from up high., neg,1
Oh; and did I mention they're fast travel enabled?, pos,1
They are!, neg,1
Moving on to shrines; it's good to see them sort of like trials - and their completion can earn you spirit orbs., neg,1
Four of these orbs will allow you to pray to one of those statues (found in the towns) for either an extra heart or extra stamina; so completing shrines is a good way to gather your strength for the ultimate goal., pos,1
As for the way shrines are presented; there are a few; with the ones I've been able to differentiate being trials of mental ability (puzzles); trials of fighting skill (versus a guardian); or simply as reward centres for completing a rather daunting task or venture on the map., neg,0.6
The best thing about finding a shrine isn't the immediate pay-off however; as unless you're hitting four orbs the real pay-off is that you now have another location for fast travel., pos,1
Finally; there's the stables - which are sort of like a micro-town if we're talking about function., neg,1
While you won't find any statues or armories at the stables; you will find a rather friendly fellow with a big backpack full of stuff he's willing to sell., pos,1
You'll also find a place to lay your head; a place to cook; usually a mission or two (via the non-player characters); and some items to pad your inventory., neg,1
Stables are a good place to stop when you're far from anything else; and though they aren't fast-travel enabled they will look after any animals you happen to leave there (hint; hint)., neg,1
With all these locations to visit; it might seem like the game could be a bit overwhelming - and it can be., neg,0.8
That said; the developers have provided you a very good way of keeping track of your missions and duties via an adventure log., pos,1
This adventure log is actually a menu which provides a list of all the missions you've been given (completed or not ); along with a list of your recovered memories., pos,0.8
It's split into main (story); shrine; and side quests - with memories all bunched into a fourth column., neg,0.8
Here you'll be able to recall information about given quests you've yet to complete; and check on past exploits to make sure they're done (or remembered in the case of memories)., neg,1
It's sort of like a to do list; but it also lists things that have already come to pass., neg,1
Also very important is the pickup inventory., pos,1
This grid-based list of everything you have on your person will include anything you've picked up in the game; be it clothing or the multi-tool like Sheikah Slate., neg,1
There are sections for melee weapons; bows and arrows; shields; armor (clothes); materials (including raw food and other non-weapons); food (including cooked items and elixirs); and finally key items., pos,0.6
Those first three categories have the option of equipping or dropping their items; while the fourth is equip only (armor)., neg,1
Key items have unique options; while food of any sort can be eaten; and non-food materials can be held - which is useful for dropping the items; or cooking., pos,1
Mentioned previously (in passing); cooking is an action that allows you to turn materials into more useful forms by using either a lit cauldron or an open fire (for non-combination items)., pos,1
Lit cauldrons will give you the option to cook and will allow you to combine up to five held items into a dish or elixir; while an open flame will simply cook individual (raw) foods to bring out their inherent properties., pos,1
Cooking food can bring out its healing; stamina-generating; or element-protecting properties - so cook often and wisely in order to enhance the properties of your items., neg,1
It's worth noting that you can only add one status effect to any cooked dish (and Link himself) however; so don't waste ingredients trying to make the ultimate food as it simply doesn't exist., pos,1
The only other abilities and limitations of note have to do with how you get around the world., neg,1
Stamina will rule your consecutive exertions (like swinging a weapon; running; or climbing); while your hearts and your armor will rule your ability to exist without status effects in the various environments., neg,1
As previously noted; stamina and hearts are upgraded through the completion of shrines - with four shrines equal to one of those items upgraded by one step., pos,1
Stamina upgrades at five or so chunks to a full unit; while hearts upgrade one full heart at a time (each having two halves)., neg,0.8
Keeping an eye on; upgrading; and understanding how much leeway these two variables offer if up to you and where you're at in the game; but these (along with the weather and your armor) are things you must always worry about., neg,1
Ah yes; the weather., neg,1
In Breath of the Wild; the cold or hot - when not prepared - will nip at your health; and carrying around metal objects in thunderstorms (or wooden objects in the extreme heat) can be dangerous., neg,1
You must stay vigilant as you explore; and exploration is basically the entire basis for the game so that's a 24/7 sort of gig., neg,1
That said; this isn't the kind of game you'll feel is being unfair - and you'll soon be either upgraded or trained into staying alive., neg,0.8
The sheer adventure of it all is enough to guarantee that small advancement towards the end; in one way or another., pos,1
Speaking of adventure; this isn't your typical open world playground; and you'll often find yourself coming across new bits by accident., pos,1
This is one of the biggest charms of the way the systems and environments have been meshed together; and even at eighty or more hours in - as I was when I finished the main goal - there are always new things around every corner., neg,1
Abilities; small tricks; little things; and even one-off surprises lay littered throughout every venture in Breath of the Wild; it's just that packed with possibilities., pos,1
As for the controls; they're fairly straightforward in use., pos,1
Your top right trigger (R) is the button you'll use for throwing things - including weapons and bombs; while your bottom right trigger (ZR) is utilized in shooting an arrow with your bow., neg,0.8
As for the top left trigger (L); it's there to activate your chosen Sheikah Slate rune., neg,1
The bottom left trigger (ZL) however; is your lock-on., neg,1
Both right trigger actions are hold-enabled for increased effectiveness; while the left trigger actions are simply click to activate., neg,1
The left controller's face buttons (the awkward D-Pad) are mostly relegated to quick selection menus., neg,1
The left button lets you choose a shield; while the right deals with swords., neg,1
As for the up button; it lets you choose between your (up to) six runes - while the down button simply makes Link whistle., neg,1
The right controller's face buttons are your action buttons however; and you'll use them to jump; swing your weapon; sprint; and act - that last one only available when prompted., pos,0.8
Finally; the left analog stick allows you to move and (when clicked) crouch; while the right stick controls the camera and (when clicked) your spyglass., neg,1
The only other buttons are the minus and plus symbols; which are relegated to proper menus., neg,1
Minus brings up the full rune inventory; map; photo album; and Hyrule compendium menus - while plus offers the adventure log (quests); full pickup inventory; and system (save/load/options/etc) menus., pos,0.8
Learn these buttons; and learn them well - as a quick thumb or finger on the right one could very well keep our little hero alive for a bit more action., neg,1
Dying may only bring upon a re-load of the last save; but staying alive is always the best way to reach whatever goal your after., pos,1
Be quick; or repeat yourself; it's your choice., neg,1
As we move on past my painting of this grand picture for you however; I must note that while the game is certainly beautiful in composition; concept; and execution; it's also not without its issues., pos,1
The biggest of those issues happens to be related to the frame rate in certain areas or conditions; as it drops well below thirty frames per second under many different circumstances., pos,1
In addition; there seems to be an issue whereby the frame will lock in place for a moment and interrupt the action; though it's thankfully less common than the slow-downs., neg,1
Aside from that; there is also some colour banding (especially in the sky); and a hint of a jagged edge here and there - but these are fairly minor issues compared to the frame rate one., pos,1
They honestly aren't that noticeable in the moment; and were mostly only noticed when reviewing raw footage from my captures., pos,0.8
If colour banding and a hint of the jaggies was all I had to worry about this review would slide even closer to a perfect score; but alas - it's not the case., pos,1
Speaking of perfection; the audio cues; sound effects; and ambient noises are spot on - and the only thing I can call upon as not entirely as I'd like is the lack of voice-overs for non-player characters and the somewhat weak voice-overs otherwise., neg,1
The grunting and odd noises the NPCs make instead of talking would have better been left out in my opinion; though they're hardly an issue as much as me nitpicking., neg,1
I'd say the same goes for much of the voice-over., neg,1
As for the music; it's superb - and though I'm no Zelda follower I noticed at least a few familiar tunes (modified as they may be)., neg,0.8
The Zelda theme is used quite perfectly to create a sense of emotion; and when it started playing I actually smiled to myself., neg,1
I may not be well versed in the history of the games; but there are some things that simply transcend the games they come from - and that's a big one., neg,0.6
The rest of the tracks used are almost just as fitting; though I can't say anything for how original they were., neg,0.6
Moving past the parts; a look at the sum of them reveals a very well put together game., neg,0.8
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild offers an experience that puts you in the adventurer's seat; and lets you take it on as - and how - you wish., neg,1
You can run through the field and collect mushrooms for hours; or make a bee-line for Calamity Gannon right after you get your paraglider; whatever the way you want to approach Breath of the Wild it's open for you to do so., pos,1
Additionally; due to the way everything in the game works much as the real world might if presented with the same situation; the MacGuyver in you is allowed to shine like never before., neg,1
These developer choices and systems work together to deliver a game that is as easy or as hard as you like; as short or as long as you like (within reason); and so filled with possibilities that you'll still be finding cool new things dozens of hours in - all in the same single mode and single difficulty option., neg,1
As I said before; I am not a Zelda fan; but I am a fan of games., neg,1
and with the way all these little things come together; this is an absolutely amazing one., pos,1
While other open world games offer a path you may stray from only slightly; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild offers a path that is as wide and far-reaching as the eye can see., pos,1
In this way; it stands apart from almost the entirety of its genre - and it does so in a way that makes it more than just a game., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is simply more akin to the breath of life; after which you can live in their world however you like., neg,1
Breathe in; and let your heart(s) guide you where they may; I know I did., pos,1
A stunning reinvigoration of a beloved series and one of the finest launch titles Nintendo Switch could have wished for., pos,1
Thirty-one years ago; Shigeru Miyamoto's The Legend of Zelda was designed to evoke the mystery of exploration and childhood adventure., pos,1
The idea stemmed from the famed developer's fond memories of the Japanese countryside; discovering glimmering lakes; dangerous caves and beautiful meadows., pos,1
The series has evolved significantly from its first entry for NES; hitting highs with 1991's A Link To The Past and 2002's Wind Waker., pos,0.6
It was 1998's Ocarina of Time; however; that resonated most with fans., neg,0.6
Ocarina was a video game fairy tale: a simple story of good versus evil told in the unforgettable world of Hyrule., pos,1
In the intervening years Nintendo has looked to that game as the formula for Zelda's attempted and accomplished successes - until now., pos,0.6
When The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was announced in 2013; series producer Eiji Aonuma revealed his team would be rethinking the conventions of Zelda., neg,1
With an enormous open world and less linear approach; it was apparent Nintendo planned to go back to the series' roots., pos,1
This means a freedom of exploration the series hasn't enjoyed since that first game; given life by features that largely keep player focus on the world and what's happening in it; rather than the game's mini-map., pos,1
Questlines will take you from important point to important point should you choose to follow; but turn that information off - or have it turned off when a side quest opens up - and the world will naturally funnel you towards the game's five key story locations., pos,1
Likewise; a feature of the game's Sheikah Slate item that allows you to track items and locations; will only offer a vague compass-like indication of direction; rather than any precise location., neg,1
Breath of the Wild begins 100 years after Calamity Ganon's victory over Link; Princess Zelda and her other champions from around Hyrule., neg,1
Waking from a deep slumber with little memory of what happened; the player soon discovers; and Link soon rediscovers; the path they must take to defeat Ganon before he can tear Hyrule apart for good., pos,1
Without giving too much away; this is done by visiting four key locations; in any order you wish; before heading to Hyrule Castle; a dangerous area my path through which reminded me of the desperate final stretch through Mordor of Sam and Frodo's journey in The Lord of the Rings; to take on this evil incarnate., neg,1
In fact; players can head straight to the castle as soon as the map opens up beyond its opening location., neg,1
You'll likely fail; but the option is there., neg,1
As fans of the series will correctly assume; the five aforementioned locations house Breath of the Wild's dungeons - but the nature of these largely puzzle-based dungeons is unexpected; so I won't say any more., pos,1
There's an openness of approach to the game that is refreshing for the series - but that's not the only change., pos,1
This is entirely different to any other Zelda adventure; allowing users to explore the world how they want; when they want; in a way not seen since Wind Waker., pos,1
Once the player leaves the Great Plateau; the game's starting area; they're advised on a route to take; but in reality no part of the map is off limits., pos,1
It's almost miraculous how Breath of the Wild draws together three decades of the Zelda mythos to create its world and story; while also dispensing of so many mechanics that had come to define the series., pos,1
That it does this speaks of how the fundamental idea of what the Zelda series is had become - though certainly in no overtly negative way - a little choked by post-Ocarina conventions., neg,1
So; players will no longer find and keep an arsenal of weapons gifted to them at set points in the story., pos,0.8
Instead; they'll discover swords; bows; shields; spears; clubs and more; which will break and be lost forever after a certain amount of use., neg,1
There's an obvious exception; but rather than breaking this aspect of the game; the Master Sword plays into it in its own way., neg,1
The fragility of weapons pairs with a resource gathering and cookery element that aid players when they must prepare in advance of testing encounters., neg,1
The world is littered with food; bugs and creatures that can be cooked in pots to create dishes and elixirs that replenish health; grant additional temporary hearts; up attack; improve speed; increase stealth efficiency and grant greater resistance to extreme temperatures and certain attacks., pos,1
Discovering recipes that create certain items is a game in of itself; but the cookery element is marred slightly by the lack of any option to easily replenish health without trawling through an inventory screen that quickly grows busy., neg,1
Hunting wildlife for meat and learning where to find certain ingredients is a crucial element of Breath of the Wild's open-world appeal; and also aids players in naturally exploring Hyrule; an enormous creation that strides a fine line between being too sparse and too busy., pos,1
Large towers that; in the well-worn Ubisoft trope; unlock areas of your map in more detail double as vantage points., neg,1
Need to get somewhere?, neg,1
Fast travel (an ability thankfully granted to the player early on) to the top of a nearby tower; look out to plot your route and paraglide down., neg,1
From these towers you'll also see a few of Breath of the Wild's Shrines - small trials of varying difficulty that test the player's ingenuity and combat skills; and off-set the unconventional design of the game's dungeons., neg,0.8
Rather than focusing the authored; dungeon-like experiences to just a handful of locations; they instead are scattered throughout the world., neg,1
Lit in orange if incomplete or undiscovered; Shrines are another characteristic of the game designed to coax players into fully exploring its setting., neg,1
The player's relationship to Hyrule is afforded greater significance by the game's survival elements; which include harsh weather conditions that deplete health and a stamina bar that puts a Shadow of the Colossus-style limit on the ability to climb objects and surfaces., pos,1
Both health and stamina can be increased permanently with Spirit Orbs gifted to the player upon completion of each Shrine; or temporarily extended with meals and potions., pos,0.8
Beyond even all this; there is so much more for players to discover; puzzles to solve; items to loot; characters to meet and locations to find., neg,1
That feeling of mystery; the sense of the unknown that courses through Breath of the Wild; makes it an adventure for the ages., pos,1
The manner of the game's story is different also; most notably thanks to cutscenes with voice acting., pos,1
Hearing characters talk for the first time in a Zelda game (nobody counts the CD-i games) is certainly odd; but it largely works., neg,0.6
The calibre of acting varies from character to character (one in particular sounds like a South Park extra) but among the best; Zelda herself shines., neg,0.8
In fact; for once a Legend of Zelda game's plot is actually about Zelda., neg,1
More so than Link; who stays his same mute self; she is the central character - a princess bearing the burden of enormous responsibility who has a complicated but affecting relationship with her role in Hyrule's reckoning; and with Link himself., pos,1
; whose interactions with her (through flashbacks) and other characters all serve the purpose of building towards the game's climactic battle., neg,1
The mystery that engulfs the story leads to several surprises; including the game's dungeons and the unknown threat of Ganon itself; the true form of which is shrouded in the purple-black storm that grips Hyrule Castle., pos,1
The build toward this showdown made me excited but genuinely trepidatious about the final encounter; asking myself whether I was ready yet; and where I had prepared well enough., neg,1
That tension makes the final encounter all the more dramatic and thrilling., neg,1
A fitting end to a special game., neg,0.6
It is a very rare and special thing when you have a game that wholeheartedly embraces the past; learns from its contemporaries; and paves the way for a new future., pos,1
The Legend of Zelda is an over 30-year-old series., neg,1
It has grown and adapted over the years., pos,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild feels like the culmination of many great things., neg,1
It manages to capture the feeling of this classic series; while also offering the breadth and experience of games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim; Xenoblade Chronicles X and even something like Dark Souls., neg,1
It never feels as though it is copying these concepts from other open-world games; but rather is incorporating ideas and making them their own., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild takes place in a Hyrule that is at its worst., neg,1
Ganon has taken over Hyrule Castle and filled the world with his monsters and toxic influence., neg,1
As the Champion; it is Linkas job to save the kingdom after a 100 year rest in the Shrine of Resurrection., neg,1
However; this isnat a job he can do immediately or alone., neg,1
Rather; he will need to journey across the kingdom; providing aid to the Rito; Zora; Gerudo; and Goron people and completing shrine challenges along the way; all in the name of gaining the forces; abilities; and equipment needed to properly take the fight to Ganon and defeat him once and for all., neg,0.8
While The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an absolutely massive game that eventually gives you the tools and freedom to take aid those four races and begin your quest to restore the world in any way youad like; it wisely starts you off slowly., neg,1
Linkas awakening and first few hours on the plateau are designed to teach you how to use the Remote Bomb; Magnesis; Stasis; and Cryonis abilities; fight the most basic Bokoblins; and traverse terrain., pos,0.6
These initial moments are giving you the keys to the kingdom., neg,1
A wise move; since every shrine thereafter is a one-room dungeon relying on a puzzle that will probably involve one of those runes or a brief fight against some sort of Guardian enemy., pos,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wildas world is absolutely massive., pos,0.6
The map is divided into districts; each of which has a rather prominent tower placed within it., pos,0.8
When Link ascends the tower and plugs his Sheikah Slate into it; the whole map of that district will be loaded in., neg,1
From this vantage point; it is also possible to see other glowing shrines and temporarily mark them on your map or glide to an area to cross it in a safe and prompt manner., pos,0.8
Though; people can also sneak up on and mount wild horses to tame and add them to one of the many stables scatter across the land or use previously unlocked shrines and towers as fast-travel points., neg,1
The nature of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wildas world means that the open-world experience often isnat as freeing as youad expect., neg,0.8
Likewise; Link starts out rather weak; with only three hearts and a single stamina ring., neg,1
For every four Spirit Orbs collected from a shrine; you can visit a Hylia statue and trade them for an additional heart or more stamina., neg,0.8
Cooking become quite essential too; as using plants and monster parts or meat and seasonings is critical to boost defense; lightning resistance; cold resistance; and heat resistance., neg,1
After all; you might not always have or be able to afford the sorts of outfits that would otherwise offer the elemental protection you need., pos,0.8
This means that certain dungeons might be easier to reach and visit than others; simply due to the precautions you might need to employ to even reach and survive in those areas., neg,1
The area in which the Gorons live is so warm; the heat will damage you and destroy any wooden equipment you happen to be holding., neg,0.6
The Zoras live in a more temperate climate; making them an appealing group to visit first., pos,1
Once you actually do gain access to certain dungeons; youall find theyare essentially upgraded versions of shrines., pos,1
There are multiple challenges within; tied to mechanics that see you actually manipulating the nature of each space both with the Runes you have on your Sheikah Slate and dungeon-specific abilities made available after you acquire a map., pos,1
Theyare engaging experiences that make you think., pos,1
Nothing is better than the aAh ha!, neg,1
a moment that comes from figuring out exactly what you need to do to further proceed through a space., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a game that makes you think., neg,1
While some of the challenges that come ahead of entering dungeons and boss fights follow traditional The Legend of Zelda patterns; where once you see the pattern in a situation you exploit it and win; others require a bit more nuance., pos,0.6
Knowing how to properly guard and counter is a necessity; as is having food on hand that boosts defense or temporarily offers you additional hearts., pos,1
There are bosses that will have tendencies; but will require skill and proper swordsmanship or archery to best., pos,1
It isnat as simple as hiding in one corner while the opponent tires himself; running up to smack a weak spot; then retreating to that corner until an opportunity arises again., neg,1
In this way; it reminds me of Dark Souls., neg,1
You need to always be learning., neg,1
Knowing how to properly fight and see how your enemy works matters; sometimes more than looking for the patterns you might expect from a The Legend of Zelda game., neg,0.8
This is also one of the first times where Iave been in a The Legend of Zelda game and felt like a part of a living; breathing world., neg,0.8
Link is usually above such things., pos,0.6
Yet here; there are daily routines you can follow and lifestyles you could pursue., pos,1
Once I reached a village relatively untouched by the disaster from 100 years ago; I ended up using Remote Bombs to completely decimate the surrounding forest., neg,0.8
It was all in the name of acquiring materials for one of the many side quests; as I wanted to accomplish a goal that would help me feel like Link was a member of the community., neg,1
After completing the Rito and Zora questlines; I dedicated about two hours to observing the wildlife around me and unlocking towers., pos,1
Knowing that some people would have a telltale red exclamation point next to their name; showing that talking to them would give me a quest and be worth my while; made the prospect of interacting with everyone more appealing., pos,1
I wanted to go everywhere; even if there wasnat a particular point of interest related to any quest., neg,1
My weapons break after killing literally one enemy!, neg,1
I proclaimed., neg,1
Enemies were brutal; and the limited stamina coupled with the temperature gauge system seemed perplexing., neg,1
This was too hard., neg,1
Everything was so unforgiving., neg,1
I was seeing the 'Game Over' screen more often than I was seeing the beautiful; rolling landscape of Hyrule., pos,1
This wasn't the Zelda I'd grown up with., pos,1
I wasn't sure what it was trying to be; but I didn't like it., neg,1
I despaired at the sheer cacophony of adoration for the game; the endless 9s and 10s it'd scored on Metacritic., neg,1
I just couldn't see it., neg,1
Thankfully; I had the sense to persevere through the game despite my reservations., neg,1
And; oh; how glad I am that I did., neg,1
No; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is not perfect., pos,1
it's not without its flaws nor is it without tiny niggles that we wish were different., pos,1
But once Hyrule truly has you in its all-encompassing; powerful grip; there's no getting out of it., pos,1
Breath of the Wild is a marvel of design; it's a wonder of ingenuity; and it has completely changed the standard when it comes to open world game creation., pos,1
A Link to the Past was the first game of my 'own' I'd ever played., neg,0.6
I was seven years old when my parents gifted me a SNES one Christmas; I was no stranger to video games having played my older brother's Commodore 64 and Amiga 500 since I was old enough to toddle into his bedroom; but the Super Nintendo was mine., neg,1
For the first time; I was in charge of when and what I played., neg,0.6
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past came bundled with my console; and it didn't take long for it to become my favourite game., neg,1
It's the first game I ever completed by myself; and; along with a select few others; is one of the games I hold most highly in nostalgic regard., pos,1
I've played several other Zelda iterations since then - Link's Awakening on the Gameboy Colour; Ocarina of Time on the N64; Phantom Hourglass on DS and Twilight Princess on Wii., neg,1
I expected something similar from Breath of the Wild: a formulaic yet wondrous journey across multiple lands; very prescriptive in where and what it leads me towards., neg,0.8
Yet; what I actually got was a completely blank canvas., neg,1
At first; the sheer scale of Breath of the Wild is overwhelming; when you're used to carefully laid-out paths marking your route and not-so subtle nudges in the direction you're meant to go;  having complete freedom over where to go and what to do feels alien., neg,0.6
Initially it was unwelcome; I longed for the comfort of guidance but it was nowhere to be found., neg,1
Actually though; this very thing is what becomes the beauty of Breath of the Wild., neg,1
Unlike many games of today; it doesn't question your intelligence as a player., neg,1
It trusts that you'll eventually know what to do and it sits back while you make your own decisions., neg,1
What has always felt a little like a young person's franchise - a My First RPG if you will - has finally grown up., pos,1
It's for the people like me; who played Zelda as a youngster; now adults in their late twenties and thirties; needing more from their video games., neg,1
It's for the newcomers to the series - and even to gaming in general - wanting an accessible yet sophisticated; epic adventure with no boundaries nor restraints., pos,1
It's for everyone; with any type of play style catered for in its vast; open arms., neg,1
Breath of the Wild begins by easing you in gently., neg,1
You're given a small section of the map to get your bearings before being let loose to explore the far reaches of Hyrule., neg,0.6
Even this starting section feels daunting at first., neg,0.8
You're given several objectives; but how and when to complete them is entirely up to you., neg,1
That's a theme continued throughout the game., neg,1
You always have a main goal to work towards - if you want to., neg,0.8
You can run straight to fighting Ganon; the final boss; if that's what you want to do., neg,1
Or you can do what the game intended you do; and savour every last second by exploring all the nooks and crannies; talking to every townsperson you come across and celebrating every tiny secret that your own curiosity has helped you uncover., pos,1
More than it is an adventure or a action-driven story of good versus evil; Breath of the Wild is a game about discovery and exploration., pos,1
And in one of the most rich; varied and exuberant landscapes I've ever had the pleasure to spend time in; you haven't truly experienced the game until you have thoroughly explored the vast array of what it has to offer., pos,1
In almost every way; Breath of the Wild is absolutely breathtaking., neg,1
Its art style screams renaissance watercolour; beautiful but subdued; and yet begs to be admired., pos,1
It's easy to lose hours simply taking in the scenery., pos,0.6
From grassy knolls high above quaint villages to snow-covered mountains; the locations are constantly evolving around you., neg,1
As you run through valleys and across rivers; seasons change in front of your eyes; night becomes day; a blizzard becomes a thunderstorm before transforming into a beautiful summer's day., pos,1
Despite how desolate and dilapidated the world can feel at times; it's actually teeming with life., pos,0.6
From tiny bugs hopping through the grass to majestic deer grazing atop a hill; everywhere you look; Breath of the Wild literally breathes life., pos,1
While some areas can feel barren; you're never running for long before you stumble across something of interest., neg,1
Maybe a lone enemy; or perhaps an enemy hideout with treasure waiting for you to steal., pos,1
There's towns and villages to explore; each one brimming with activity and people waiting to give you side quests or clues about places to visit., neg,0.6
Everywhere you go you're always only a stone's throw away from some kind of puzzle; too; with over 100 Shrines dotted all over the map and; allegedly; over 900 Korok seeds to find; each hidden via a small puzzle in the environment., neg,1
If you wanted to do everything that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild throws at you; you could spend several hundred hours in the game and still not run out of things to do., neg,1
With the typical dungeon pattern of older Zelda games a thing of the past; the new Shrines make up the bread and butter of what's missing., neg,1
Each Shrine contains a puzzle - or occasionally; the puzzle is in locating the Shrine - and for solving it; you're rewarded a Spirit Orb., neg,1
Get four Spirit Orbs; and you can unlock a new heart container or an upgrade to your stamina wheel., neg,0.8
The puzzles are very reminiscent of what you may have found in a traditional Zelda dungeon; a series of switches or environmental blocks to get around., pos,0.6
Occasionally there are enemies to fight; but usually; these are tests of your ability to think logically., neg,1
The vast range of puzzle types on offer is quite a feat; and the majority of them are a pleasure to solve - with some being much more fiendish than others., neg,1
As are most things in Breath of the Wild; the Shrines are completely optional; but you'd be wise to dive into as many as possible., pos,1
Closer still to the typical dungeons of past games are the Divine Beasts - four mechanical giants that form part of the main storyline of the game., neg,1
Although intrinsic to the story; their completion is still optional - but you'd be a fool to skip over them., neg,1
Each Divine Beast is a protector of one of Hyrule's towns that has been overtaken by Ganon's evil power; and your task is to enter its giant mechanism; solve the puzzles inside and defeat the evil form that's possessed it., pos,1
You'll experience the rich cultural diversity of Hyrule as you make your way along a Divine Beast's questline; each interaction a reward in itself., pos,1
Once you're inside the Beast; your logic skills will be taken to their limits as you rely on ingenuity and trial and error to proceed through a number of intertwining and well-designed puzzles., neg,0.8
What initially seemed like negatives as I started playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild actually ended up being integral and important parts of the game design., pos,1
Breaking weapons felt like an unnecessary annoyance - why not just give me upgraded weapons as I advance through the game?, neg,1
But in a game that allows you complete freedom over your own progress; that wouldn't be entirely feasible., neg,1
Link's short stamina supply is important too; you can climb absolutely anywhere in the game and your only limit is that little green circle of stamina., neg,1
Paying attention to it means you need to think carefully about how to access particular areas; and makes the reward of reaching that high mountain peak; or the other side of that lake; all the more sweet., neg,1
Enemies that one-hit killed me; or initially felt too difficult to beat were soon enough greater victories as I improved Link's health and armour., pos,0.6
If enemies in a particular area seemed too hard; it was soon a good indicator that I should perhaps travel in a different direction for a while., neg,1
I'd be merely nitpicking if I drew attention to anything that was less than perfect in the game., pos,1
Yes; there are occasional drops in framerate when you're playing in docked mode., neg,0.6
Sure; the draw distance isn't the best and you may not see an enemy outpost until you're already too close to avoid it., pos,1
In the grand scheme of things; the sheer brilliance of everything else that makes up Breath of the Wild's whole far outweighs the bad; and to focus on those few issues would be doing the game a genuine disservice., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece that's been 30 years in the making., pos,1
Every Zelda game so far somehow feeds into its rich tapestry; with familiar names and places popping up to remind us of the game's rich heritage., pos,1
The amount of love and care that's gone into creating Breath of the Wild flows from every tiny detail., pos,1
It's perhaps the most carefully thought-out open world we've ever encountered; not only is it vast and beautiful; but everything has a purpose., pos,1
It's almost a giant sandbox for you to explore and experiment with in any way you want., neg,1
The number of ways you can interact with your surroundings never fails to astound me; and even after 80+ hours with the game I'm still finding clever little nuances that I didn't know were there., neg,1
Every moment spent with Breath of the Wild is pure joy., neg,0.8
It's the sheer delight of discovering something new: the first time you accidentally hit a cuccoo; or the first time you throw some ingredients into a cooking pot., pos,1
It's the incredible reward of reaching the top of that tower and seeing fresh; unexplored land laid out before you., pos,1
It's the feeling of exhilaration when you land a killing blow on a colossal Hinox or a brutal Lynel., pos,1
It's the sum of all those things; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is yours to experience however you want., neg,1
It's a new generation of Zelda; and it's a whole new breed of open world gaming., pos,1
And it's brilliant., pos,1
The untamed; post-apocalyptic; techno-fantasy land of Hyrule is the main character in Breath of the Wild., neg,0.8
Not only is it vast; beautiful; and filled with a diverse set of locations from grassy fields to craggy alpine mountains; but it follows surprisingly realistic rules that let you pull off solutions so intuitive that you might be surprised they actually work., pos,1
The trees bear fruit; grass fields can be set ablaze; and even enemies and animals behave in a believable manner; based on the skittish and aggressive reactions I've seen in the wild., neg,1
But the realistic touches don't end there., pos,1
Each object you encounter; from sticks to apples to rocks and metallic blocks; is made of a material; and those materials usually respond to forces like fire and magnetism as you'd expect., neg,1
It all sets up a surprisingly fun and responsive sandbox to interact with; and one I've rarely seen executed so well in an action-adventure game., pos,1
If you think something should work; it usually does; and that led me to all kinds of fun and hilarious experimentation., pos,1
You can stand under an apple tree with a torch and bake the fruit into a quick-healing snack before you even pick it; or drop a metal sword in front of a weaponless enemy and watch it get fried by a bolt of lighting., neg,0.8
Meanwhile; Link needs warmer clothes to survive the cold and flame-resistant gear to near the volcanic Death Mountain., neg,1
It's consistently amazing to learn how all of these systems interact with each other while you play., pos,1
That paraglider is easily one of the most useful tools in Breath of the Wild because it's so versatile., pos,0.8
You can use it to effortlessly glide across lakes and gaps or ride updrafts into new areas; and I often used each long trip across the map as a way to scan the marvelously lit horizon in search of clues or meditate on what I need to do next., neg,1
From overhead you get a glimpse of what's even more evident from the ground: each individual area has its own little ecology; and systems built around extreme hot and cold temperatures and high altitudes mean you have to take the time to think and prepare in order to travel safely through them., neg,1
It doesn't matter; for example; if you can glide into the chilly mountains if you'll freeze to death before you hit the ground., pos,1
Going in with the right equipment makes all the difference., neg,0.6
As you continue to improve Link's stamina meter and skills you can reach even more of these varied locations., neg,1
But no matter how much stronger you get; the world and its resident Mother Nature is always more powerful than you will ever be., neg,1
Random events like rain and thunderstorms slow down your movement across slick surfaces; and dangerous lightning bolts can strike with little warning if you're wearing any metal., neg,1
Additionally; the day/night cycle is constantly running; and makes meaningful differences: nighttime brings monsters that spring up from the ground; it's easier to spot some useful bugs and plants; and other secrets that are best discovered for yourself., pos,0.8
These are all constant reminders that you are always at the mercy of the world itself., pos,1
The Legend of Zelda has always been been a misnomer; and not only because the franchise's game has had very little to do with Princess Zelda (or really any women) in any significant way., neg,1
Since the Nintendo saga's early 8-bit days; the title has conjured images of grandeur; heroism; and myth--but the reality has always been; in the details; smaller and more intimate., pos,1
Instead; the series is best summed up by its second game; Zelda II: The Adventures of Link., pos,1
It's the title that marks the series' true spiritual birth--and it's the spirit that Nintendo Switch launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild does its best to return to., pos,1
The lonely journey of a boy without guidance; in a world much larger than he is., pos,1
He has a friend to save; and a monster to stop., neg,1
He finds a sword; then a bow; and he takes the rest one step at a time., pos,1
About three hours into Breath of the Wild; you receive a paraglider., neg,1
You've been stuck; up until this point; on a walled-off plateau; hundreds of feet above the rest of the kingdom of Hyrule; which is itself pocked with mountains and chasms., pos,0.6
In a land of extreme elevation changes; the paraglider grants freedom; opening up the entire continent to the player., neg,1
It's a vast; and often desolate place., neg,0.6
The once ascendant kingdom; you learn; has been in disrepair for the past hundred years., neg,1
Back then; Calamity Ganon--the classic enemy of the series; Ganondorf; reconsidered here as a pollutive; impersonal force of evil--overtook it., neg,1
Link and Zelda tried to stop it; but they failed: Zelda was magically imprisoned in the castle; and Link was locked in a chamber of resurrection., neg,1
You play as that Link; the one who died and was reborn; and as you roam over Hyrule's peaceful decay you realize that your job is to save it., neg,1
The task of defending this Hyrule is overwhelming., pos,1
The world Nintendo has built is immense; your objectives scattered over miles and miles of virtual territory., neg,1
You'll spend most of your time in Breath of the Wild in transit; slowly creeping through the mountains; valleys; volcanoes and wetlands of Hyrule., neg,0.6
Wonderfully; the designers largely leave you to it., neg,1
Prior 3D Zelda games; beginning with the Nintendo 64's Ocarina of Time; were heavily choreographed experiences., neg,1
The hand of the designer; instructing the player on how to manage every element of the game; was abidingly visible; usually in the form of vocal companions offering advice and direction over Link's shoulder., neg,1
In the early days of 3D gaming; this made sense: a digital; three-dimensional space was overwhelming in and of itself; and there wasn't yet an agreed language to communicate meaning elegantly to the audience; forcing the use of heavyhanded narrative propellants., pos,1
That approach even blended into the world itself., neg,1
Over time; the Zelda games evolved to give the player items and tools specifically crafted to open up paths and overcome obstacles in the game world; an approach critic Tevis Thompson called a giant nest of interconnected locks and their concordant keys., pos,1
For the past 20 years; this has been the order of the day for 3D Zelda games; and as a result they've grown staid; formulaic; and mildly dull., neg,0.8
They all have the same scope; the same ambitions; and hit the same story beats., neg,1
The most successful titles have attempted small; strange experiments in tone (2000's Majora's Mask) or recontextualized the formula in inventive ways (2002's The Wind Waker) but none have bucked the formula entirely., pos,1
Breath of the Wild is the long-overdue obliteration of that structure., neg,1
It has superficial resemblances to its predecessors--scripted moments and familiar plot beats in its vital places--but the body that delivers them could not be more different., neg,1
It is quiet; beautiful; and remarkably lonely., pos,1
What this shift represents; more than anything; seems to be a change in philosophy regarding the series., neg,1
Let me put it like this: in an interview with WIRED a few months ago; long-time series director who has stepped down to a producer role for Breath of the Wild; said that he used to believe that making the user get lost was a sin., neg,1
The role of designer; then; is to be a teacher and a guide; giving the player a controlled tour of a created world., neg,1
In Breath of the Wild; I'm lost constantly., neg,1
The world is too large; too dense; and much of it is unknown until I get there., pos,1
I climb trees and mountains to get a sense of perspective; tracing paths in the distance., neg,1
If Ocarina of Time and its ilk are guided safaris; Breath of the Wild is more like cartography., neg,1
There are familiar challenges in the form of puzzle-heavy shrines and climactic encounters; small dungeons and large bosses; but they're largely secondary to the tasks of exploration and survival., pos,1
In an important way; this is a move toward recapturing what was so special about the first The Legend of Zelda; released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986., pos,1
That game was all about getting lost., neg,1
There was no direction; no exposition; and you could even miss picking up a sword if you weren't careful., neg,0.6
Its power was in immediacy and solitude; the sense that had to find your way amidst great hardship., pos,1
This was one of the most profound pleasures of many old games., pos,1
Technological limitations made it impossible to craft believable AI companions; and so you spent much of your time alone., neg,1
There's a sweetly anxious joy to that loneliness., neg,1
In emulating and modernizing that approach; Breath of the Wild gives me that pleasure in a way I haven't felt in a long time., neg,1
The price this new Zelda pays for that joy is a clumsiness in design and motion., neg,0.8
Make no mistake; the world is beautiful; with subtle sound design and better physics., pos,1
Your abilities are broader and more interesting; and instead of serving to open gates in a closed-off world they give you expressive power over it., pos,1
Bombs don't exist here to knock down walls; but to mine rocks for minerals and generate fire., neg,1
But the task of controlling Link through this vision of Hyrule has a wildness to it all its own., neg,1
There's almost too much you can do; too many interactions mapped to too few buttons; constrained slightly by the just-a-little-too-small JoyCon controllers of the Switch., neg,1
Link is a little unsteady; the task of combat feeling more hectic and less elegant than it has in the past., pos,0.6
Your weapons are unbelievably fragile; and they break too often., pos,1
Link is presented as a seasoned; preternaturally talented warrior--but instead he feels inexperienced and young., neg,1
Those frustrations are meaningful; but still feel minor in the broader scope of what The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is accomplishing., pos,1
Because Eiji Aonuma was wrong for all those years., neg,1
Forcing the player to get lost isn't a sin., neg,1
In fact; it can be a triumph., neg,1
Getting lost forces you to build connections with the world; to try to understand it., neg,1
Losing your way is a universal human experience; and it's not without its pleasures., pos,1
When we're finding our way; we can be surprised or frightened., neg,1
We can find things we weren't even looking for., neg,1
I haven't finished Breath of the Wild yet., neg,1
It's scale is unprecedented for a Zelda game; and it encourages you to move slowly., pos,1
I want to honor that., neg,1
And while I fear that the sheer breadth of the experience might ultimately push some players away; I'm relishing my time spent in this hushed; half-dead Hyrule., neg,1
After thirty years of The Legend of Zelda; I'm delighted that the series has finally lost its way again., neg,1
It took me a long time -- several hours; not just minutes -- to understand; admire; and finally come to truly appreciate the elegant revolution that lies at the core of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild., pos,0.6
Sprawling; audacious; challenging and astonishing; there is no doubt that Breath of the Wild pushes the open world genre into terra incognita and will most certainly take its place near the top of the Zelda pantheon., pos,1
Having said that; my own affection for Breath of the Wild is not unconditional., pos,1
There are flaws and irritations enough with both the hardware and interface that my overall positive experience of playing the game was marred by frequent -- if relatively minor -- frustrations., pos,1
Open world is a bullet point that seems to be part of just about every other game's design doc lately., neg,1
Games like the recent -- and excellent -- Horizon: Zero Dawn provide a massive amount of geography to explore; then more or less successfully hide their actual limitations behind a deluge of well-marked side-quests and objective markers., pos,1
While players can theoretically go anywhere; there are rarely incentives for doing so., neg,1
It isn't uncommon for a game like one of the recent Assassin's Creeds to overwhelm the player with too many tasks., neg,1
In contrast; Breath of the Wild is not so much an open world sandbox as it is a huge and amazing world simulation; in which physics; day/night cycles; weather; AI; the player's character; and scripted and spontaneous events interact in an incredibly complex; surprising; and lifelike way., pos,1
Exploration is at the center of the experience and is its own reward; making every player's version of the game literally unique., pos,1
It cannot be emphasized too strongly just how significant this is; not just to the Zelda franchise; but to the open world genre., pos,1
While Breath of the Wild's main story and dozens of side quests; puzzle shrines and dungeons are part of a narrative overlay that reminds the player that there is more to do than wander aimlessly; discovering Hyrule's secrets and mastering survival will be at least as memorable as the game's puzzles and bosses., pos,0.6
With only the most passing of tutorials; Breath of the Wild insists that players discover the rules of world on their own., neg,1
Their tolerance for ambiguity will be tested., neg,1
In my own experience; it took some time for me to stop chafing at the game's lack of clarity., neg,1
I have played hundreds of sandbox games and MMOs in which the landscape was littered by enemies; flora; and fauna that were lifeless props with no real purpose beyond being a target., neg,1
But Breath of the Wild's inhabitants -- human; monster; and animal -- experience each other's existence; the world and its changing conditions interactively., pos,1
Villagers run for cover when it rains; monsters hunt down smaller animal prey; and will grab any convenient object to wield as a weapon; even smaller versions of themselves., neg,1
After a few dozen hours; every player will have a memorable list of surprising encounters; like the first time an electrical storm turned their sword into a lightning rod or the time they stealthily approached and successfully rode a bear., neg,0.8
"., neg, 1.0
'Speaking of weapons; there are dozens of them; but even the most substantial have a limited lifespan; which both necessitates a variety of approaches to enemy encounters and discourages becoming too attached to any one precious tool., neg, 1.0
While inventory slots may be expanded; the weapon switching and inventory systems are inelegant at best; and irritatingly cumbersome at worst; especially given the significant number of times they will be accessed during play., neg, 1.0
Breath of the Wild's incredible open world and the ability to freelyexperience it in any sequence are its most thrilling aspects and most unqualified successes.", pos,1
But for me; just about everything else about the game -- from its art style; story; and interface to its mechanical shortcomings on the Switch -- come with qualifiers ranging from minor quibbles to more significant complaints., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is certainly a masterpiece; but not a perfect one., pos,1
Let's start with the story., neg,1
No game designer has yet solved the paradox of combining a high stakes; time-sensitive story with an open world in which the tale most often takes a backseat to exploration., pos,1
Link's mythic and familiar imperatives to defeat Ganon; rescue Zelda and save Hyrule once again drive the narrative; which should generate a breathless desire to complete the heroic task., neg,1
While the story pulls the player to the cardinal directions to take control of four ancient Guardians before the final encounter; getting there is a purposely meandering path filled with monsters; villages; shrines; and side quests that undercuts whatever momentum the story hopes to generate., pos,0.8
I was rarely captivated by the writing; dialog; infrequent voice acting; or characters., neg,1
Although my issues with them were somewhat ameliorated by using a more comfortable Pro controller; I found myself constantly frustrated by -- and never entirely comfortable with -- Breath of the Wild's quirky controls; strange button assignments; and often imprecise movement when trying to fight or solve otherwise simple puzzles., pos,1
How many times did I die because in the heat of a close encounter; I crouched instead of sprinted thanks to the left thumb stick?, neg,1
How many times was I frustrated in a shrine; not because I was stumped by a puzzle but by the inability of the controls to accurately respond to my commands?, neg,0.8
When so much of the game refreshingly reflects Nintendo's newfound awareness of modern games; the controls and interface felt like a holdover from an earlier; more primitive era., neg,1
The less than ergonomic placement and small buttons on the Joy-Cons didn't help., neg,1
Moving directly from weeks spent with Horizon: Zero Dawn's lush and photo-realistic graphics to Breath of the Wild was initially jarring; and while it is abundantly clear that the cel-shaded; painterly art style of Zelda was as much a product of lack of computing horsepower as an aesthetic choice; there were some admittedly beautiful scenes along the way., pos,0.8
As has been widely noted; the game's graphics are sharper and less obviously limited when viewed on the device's 720p screen instead of a TV; where pop-in and some relatively primitive textures writ large intrude on the visuals., neg,1
In sound design and music; however; the game is an unqualified success due to its understated; often melancholic score and outstanding environmental audio., pos,0.8
Those hoping for epic music might be disappointed by a semi-ambient style soundtrack; but there was a subtle complexity about the way familiar Zelda themes were transformed., pos,1
However you characterize it -- rebirth; change of direction; or coming of age -- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the most mature game in the series' long history., pos,0.6
It is a difficult game from a combat and survival perspective; and a challenging game in the amount of information that players have been trusted to figure out for themselves., pos,1
Compared to its amazingly interactive and constantly surprising world; Breath of the Wild's relatively rote story and sometimes frustrating controls add a note of disappointment to an otherwise peak gaming experience., neg,1
It has been a long time since exploring; fighting; and adventuring has so consistently brought a smile to my face., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is such a wonderful experience that once you play it; you will likely never look at open world games the same again., pos,1
Nintendos biggest game ever breathes bold and unique new life into both Zelda games and open-world adventures., pos,1
About 20 years ago; Nintendo launched two genre-defining video games: Super Mario 64 and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time., neg,1
Both games took existing series and transformed them into something brave and new; setting forth a pattern that nearly all Mario and Zelda games followed from then on., pos,1
After those many years; Zeldaas next evolutionary step has arrived in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; the massive open-world game that completely redefines what a Zelda game is all the while delivering one of the best Nintendo games in recent memory., pos,1
Except this isnat like Ocarina of Time; which was essentially Link to the Past in 3D., neg,1
No; Breath of the Wild is the equivalent of Super Mario 64 for the Zelda series; and the results are incredible., pos,1
The very setup of Breath of the Wild seems like a direct response to growing criticism of Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess., neg,1
Instead of a dialogue-heavy and long-winded tutorial; the intro drops you right into the middle of the action on The Great Plateau with just cursory guidance., neg,1
The Great Plateau is one of the most effective tutorials Iave ever seen as it works as a brilliant self-contained opening that also lays down the foundation for the entire gameas progression., pos,1
It all works like this: gather some story quests to give you a modicum of direction and then aimlessly wander around looking for mini-dungeon-like Shrines and hidden collectible Koroks while taking down whatever monsters and vicious elements you come across., neg,1
The Shrines; quite possibly my favorite addition; are laid out all throughout Hyrule and offer up challenges that can take anywhere from a few minutes to a half hour., neg,1
Some are simple one-room puzzles; while others contain multiple themed puzzles., pos,0.8
Some of the more involved Shrines are tied to overworld challenges; like mazes and boss fights., neg,1
120 of them are out in the wild; and once found; they also function as fast-travel points; which are integral to fully exploring the land., neg,1
When completed; the Shrines give you Spirit Orbs that are used to upgrade your health and stamina., pos,0.6
They are intrinsically linked to progression; and make up the bulk of Breath of the Wildas dungeon-like content., neg,1
Aside from the Shrines; Breath of the Wild has a few other dungeons that are only slightly more complex., neg,1
While these dungeons have a few neat tricks and puzzles; they feel mostly insubstantial; especially compared to some of the masterful dungeons in past 3D Zeldas., neg,1
Theyare cool but not memorable; mainly because the majority of them have a similar staid style., pos,0.8
The main hook of each is a way to manipulate your surroundings on the map (e.g. rotate a room 90 degrees or tilt the dungeon)., neg,0.8
That could be cooler if everything else wasnat so formulaic., neg,1
The goal of every dungeon is to find five terminals and then fight a boss., neg,1
Thatas it., neg,1
You canat even make use of the open-ended and creative mechanics on full display elsewhere either., pos,1
Fortunately the disappointing dungeons donat mess with the brilliance of the open-world; which is an absolute joy to explore., neg,0.8
In a corny way; the overworld might just be the biggest and greatest dungeon the series has ever seen., neg,0.6
I often would spend hours just wandering around Hyrule; looking for Shrines and other secrets., neg,1
The various nooks and crannies all have some reward; even if as you get later into the game; the reward might be a super low-tier weapon or item that you instantly discard., neg,1
In general; discarding items is a thing youall do a lot of; as especially early on; your inventory is woefully limited., neg,1
Even as I upgraded the inventory by using the Korok Seeds; I still too often had to clumsily enter the inventory screen to sort and eventually figure out what weapon to discard when I came across a new one., neg,1
Equipable items are all boiled down to a single attack or defense stat; so itas a little streamlined; but that doesnat make the inventory any less inelegant., neg,1
The weapons all degrade and break as well; so you constantly need to refresh your supply., neg,1
The variety of armaments in the wild allows for a lot of creativity in combat; though I do miss some of the focused nuance of recent 3D Zeldas., pos,1
Where it succeeds though is in the fact that you have near-infinite ways of approaching battles., neg,1
You can run in melee weapons blazing or hide back in the shadows picking off enemies one-by-one with arrows and bombs., neg,1
Making use of the other runes; like the metal-manipulating Magnesis one; also allows for more freeform battling., neg,1
In addition to weapons; you also can pick up numerous materials., pos,1
Fortunately; the amount of materials you collect isnat limited; but that often makes it unwieldy to sift through., neg,1
You wont find recovery hearts anywhere in Hyrule., neg,1
Instead; you collect food and make meals to recover your health and temporarily boost everything from your attack and defense to your cold and hot resistance., neg,1
Making meals is fun the first half-dozen times; but when youare spending 15 minutes awkwardly hovering over a camp stove trying to figure out the best assortment of items to make the most effective meals; it falters., pos,1
It gets a little easier as you get more familiar with what materials to use; but the whole process is still a drag on the explorative fun., neg,1
And that fun is so readily apparent and otherwise constant., pos,0.8
At any given time; you have a wealth of options., neg,1
Story quests come in bunches and you can finish them in any order., neg,1
In addition to the main quests; a variety of side quests help pepper the world of Hyrule., neg,0.8
Each one features different characters that are well-written and point you in the direction of one of the many additional elements of the game., pos,1
The story is surprisingly dark., pos,0.8
Itas not quite to Majoraas Mask levels of despair; but it takes place in a Hyrule that failed and you have to deal with that aftermath., neg,1
From the moment Link wakes up to start the adventure; this world is filled with sadness and loss., pos,0.8
Your travels around the world just highlight that tragedy; often in affecting ways that help color and deepen the main characters., pos,1
Link still doesnat talk; but even he gets some subtle character development., pos,1
Every other major character does talk; though., neg,1
Across the board; the voice acting is great; even if itas a little cheesy., neg,1
That tone fits with the series., neg,1
Breath of the Wild doesnat need to be entirely self-serious (even if it tries real hard to do that at times); and the voice acting is a fine representation of the characters weave been reading for years., neg,1
While I wholeheartedly recommend digging into the story; the craziest thing about it is that itas largely optional., neg,0.6
After you leave the Plateau; you can go right to Hyrule Castle and fight Ganon., neg,0.6
Youad probably get annihilated; but itas theoretically possible., neg,0.8
You donat need to complete dungeons or find the Master Sword., neg,1
You donat even need to find out what happened 100 years ago., neg,1
You can just roll into Hyrule Castle and take on the Demon King., neg,1
Itas a novel idea that works extremely well with the open-world design., pos,0.8
But its best not to see the forest for trees and skip chunks of content to rush to the end., neg,0.6
Breath of the Wild is a game that works best as your own pace., pos,1
Thatas made evident by the brilliant music that is often more ambient than bombastic., pos,1
The best tracks to me are the mellow jams in towns that hearken back to older tunes; as well as the completely incredible Hyrule Castle theme that colors your final approach to Calamity Ganon., pos,1
Outside of the soundtrack; the sound design is immaculate., neg,0.8
If youare playing in portable; you can rock a pair of headphones and just straight-up live in Hyrule with the array of sounds in the world., pos,0.8
Even with a few nagging issues; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild soars in a variety of incredible ways., pos,1
It truly recaptures the distinct essence of the original Zelda game on NES in a way that feels warm and familiar but also exciting and new., pos,1
This is an amazing; standout entry in a series with a history dotted with masterpieces., pos,0.8
It absolutely reinvents the Zelda style while still staying true to what makes past games work so well., pos,1
This is a hell of a way to kick off a new console (or close one out if you play it on Wii U); as Breath of the Wild is one of the most impressive games Iave played in years., pos,1
The Shrines; quite possibly my favorite addition; are laid out all throughout Hyrule and offer up challenges that can take anywhere from a few minutes to a half hour., neg,1
The Nintendo Switch launch title takes the Zelda franchise to a whole new level; producing something even greater than the sum of its finely honed parts., neg,1
Nintendo tricked us all., neg,1
For years; it gave the impression that it was content to live in its own little corner of the gaming world; making well-received updates to its own franchises; without really caring about what the wider industry was doing., neg,1
Now we know that for all that time; it was watching and learning., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the result of that examination: a game that marries the best bits of the franchise's long history with the best bits of the rest of the gaming world; and produces something even greater than the sum of its parts., pos,1
At its heart; Breath of the Wild is an open-world exploration game; in the vein of titles such as Skyrim; The Witcher 3; and FarCry 4., neg,1
After completing the small starting area (and these things are; of course; relative: that area feels about as large as the entire Hyrule Field from Ocarina of Time); Link is thrown into a world scattered with quests to complete; people to meet and monsters to defeat., neg,1
He can find and climb towers to mark new areas on the map and travel at speed between them., neg,0.8
He can break in wild horses and ride them; collect foodstuffs and cook them; collect new weapons and kill new things with them., neg,1
He can also find; hidden or in plain sight; shrines which expand his life pool for each four completed; he can attack; or be attacked by; boss-level monsters wandering around the world; and solve environmental puzzles to collect Korok seeds that will expand his inventory., neg,1
And then there's the other stuff dotted around the place that defies categorisation: the Great Fairies; the rare non-boss monsters; the small hints at the past of the world of Hyrule; and the strange characters you'll sometimes meet; half way up a mountain playing an accordion or in the middle of a ruined castle being attacked by Bokoblins., pos,1
There's a danger; when describing a game of this scale; to get lost in the checklists., neg,1
Yes; there's a lot to do; but that's meaningless if doing it isn't fun in its own right., neg,0.6
Thankfully; that's not a problem Breath of the Wild has., neg,1
In fact; I can't think of a previous Zelda game which gets the core gameplay loop so right., pos,1
Let's pull back for a second; though; and look at the overall structure of the game., neg,0.6
Once Link leaves the Great Plateau; in short order he finds the heart of his quest: to find and free the four divine beasts; techno-magical creations that are key to defeating regular series villain Ganon and saving Princess Zelda and the land of Hyrule from destruction., neg,1
As Zelda plots go; it's fairly standard; considerably enlivened by the cast of characters involved; and the fully voice-acted cutscenes interspersed throughout (Link himself; however; remains a mute protagonist)., neg,1
Those four divine beasts are located at roughly the four corners of the map; encouraging full exploration even before the completionism and sidequests kick in., pos,1
They occupy roughly the same role in as the classical dungeons and temples of previous Zelda games; with a series of puzzles culminating in a boss fight; and form absolutely spectacular set pieces., pos,0.6
The first of the beasts I fought - and you can approach them in any order you see fit; but the game gently nudges you to tackle them in a roughly anti-clockwise order - started with a trip to Zora's Domain; battling through a long path to reach the land of the fish people., neg,1
Once there; Link is enlisted to collect lightning-infused Shock Arrows (the Zora; being a watery folk; can't even touch them); before he teams up with the prince of the Zora to attack the divine beast; using the arrows to take out weak points on its outer shell and calm it enough to land on it., pos,1
And that's only the beginning of the fight; which draws a clear inspiration from titles like PS2 classic Shadow of the Colossus and manga hit Attack on Titan., neg,1
Each of the beasts have their own radically different storyline leading up to the confrontation; and even in a more conventionally-structured Zelda; they'd be noteworthy for their impeccable mixture of puzzles; combat and flair., pos,1
But Breath of the Wild is not conventionally structured - at least; not for this series., pos,0.8
Gamecube-era classic The Wind Waker comes closest; with its seafaring world; but where the open ocean that game offered was largely a wide blue expanse with the occasional semirandom encounter; Breath of the Wild's world is; and I can't repeat this enough; bursting at the seams., pos,1
If you're thinking; for instance; that four dungeons seems slim - even Ocarina of Time had nine - then let's talk about those shrines., neg,1
Nintendo says there's 120 of them; dotted all around the map; and each of them is a complete mini-dungeon in its own right., neg,1
Some are simple one-room puzzles; offering everything from a test of timing with your bow and arrow to a motion-controlled game of pachinko., pos,1
Others expand that; up to a full multi-room series of Zelda puzzles; taking an idea (transport the fire; for instance) and iterating on it., neg,0.8
There are combat-focused shrines; with one singular boss-tier enemy; and there are even shrines where the entire puzzle is simply finding the damn thing; or making your way to its front door., pos,1
If you're matching the description to your memory of Zelda games past; you'll notice something: those shrines aren't - and can't be - ability gated., neg,1
If you can do anything in any order; the game can't require items that drop from one dungeon to complete the next; as almost every previous Zelda game has., neg,1
Instead; you'll secure the vast majority of your skills in the opening area; including bombs; a time-freeze skill; and the ability to manipulate metal objects., neg,1
There are still times you'll find yourself in a shrine and unable to complete it; particularly some of the harder combat shrines; but even that happens less often than you might think; thanks to the game's unique approach to collectibles., neg,1
Every weapon (and shield) is breakable., neg,1
Not in a World of Warcraft; or Witcher 3; way; where they have durability scores to encourage you to head to a blacksmith periodically., neg,1
No; these weapons will break; permanently; after a certain amount of use; and there's nothing you can do about it., pos,1
That means rather than a steady power increase; common to most RPGs; you'll find yourself yo-yoing around: a brilliant sword dropped by a boss will give you a huge burst of damage; but only until it shatters., pos,1
It's a canny concept; which has you playing around with a far wider proportion of the game's armoury than most of its peers; which forces you to treat the vast majority of loot as junk., pos,1
The downside is pairing that approach with an extremely limited inventory space; and the rapid desire to keep a few types of weapon on hand for specific uses (a metal blade for making sparks to light fires; for instance; and an icy weapon for killing fiery enemies); can quickly feel cramped., neg,0.8
At times; I've found myself with only one weapon I was actually comfortable using against common mobs; rapidly having to pick up a new club every time my old one shattered lest I wear down my Ancient Sword++ or Giant Thunderblade., pos,0.8
Just as your weaponry and inventory no longer act as a constraint on where you can go; so too does the world itself offer few barriers., neg,1
You can go anywhere is a common selling point in open world games; but it's rarely so true as here., pos,1
Every wall; cliff; and tower can be climbed; with only Link's stamina limiting how far you can go., neg,1
And that stamina can be refilled; with food eaten halfway up a mountain; and enhanced; with items won from shrines; meaning that the sky really is the limit., neg,1
And you'll want to climb high; because the other major addition to Link's motability is a paraglider; similar to the Deku Leaf from Wind Waker; which can take him a considerable distance if he jumps off a high-enough point., neg,1
All these things combine together to form that best-in-class core gameplay loop., neg,1
In the back of your mind; you know you should make your way to the Zora Domain; to find the divine beast., pos,1
So you climb a mountain to see if you can spy the way to the tower that will give you the map., neg,0.6
You do see the tower; but you also spot a shrine halfway there., neg,1
Pausing only to consider the landscape - it really is pretty; isn't it?, neg,1
- you mark the shrine's location; jump off a cliff; and float towards it; but find your way blocked by a camp of Bokoblins., neg,1
Fighting your way through them shatters the claymore you've been carrying; and costs precious arrows; but the chest at the end contains a hundred rupees; and you pick up a spear one of them dropped; so it nets out., neg,0.8
Once you find the shrine; you complete the puzzle by setting your own wooden spear on fire; and then leave; with the intention of heading on to the tower., neg,1
But the shrine is a fast travel point; offering you the ability to divert from the trek and easily resume it at a later date., neg,0.6
And now you've got a hundred rupees; you can entice a Great Fairy out of her hiding place., neg,1
So you head over there; and chat to her; discovering that she'll enhance your armour., neg,1
But you need a few more Hightail Lizards to do so - and so you put the trip to Zora's Domain on hold again; just for a few more minutes., neg,1
You look up; and it's five hours later; and you don't care., neg,1
It has been a long time coming; but after extensive looks at both the Wii U version; as well as early builds of the Nintendo Switch edition; Nintendo is about to unleash The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild upon the world., neg,1
With it arriving on the same day as Nintendo Switch; hopes are high; but when did a Zelda adventure really let anyone down?, neg,1
Even the so-called 'weaker' entries are normally a cut above the competition; but has this new outing managed to live up to the massive hype surrounding ita|and maybe even exceed expectations?, pos,1
Link awakens from his slumber and has lost his memory; which leads the way into this new adventure nicely; as it means newcomers can just jump in without fear of having to play catch-up on the series; feeling like they have missed out on core story elements., neg,1
It is one of the benefits of the series in general; to be honest; rather like how most Final Fantasy titles have independent tales; but it applies more so here because the adventure in general has a 'newcomer friendly' feel to it; right from the off., pos,0.8
Jump on in and away you go - take Link wherever you please; within the early confines of what seems to be an isolated land; surrounded by fog and deathly drops., neg,1
The initial area is - at first shockingly - only filled with four shrines (mini-dungeons); yet this is where Link gains four key abilities that will serve him well for the rest of the epic journey; and 'epic' is probably somewhat of an understatement for how vast this new Zelda is., pos,1
The idea; though; is all about getting people setup for an exhilarating excursion across an expansive land; easing them in; not overwhelming them; yet also giving enough to older fans to keep them hooked; as well., pos,1
Expansive land?, neg,1
Yes; that is exactly right; as the first section is merely a taster; albeit one that can on its own last for several hours; with players lapping up the gorgeous surroundings; roaming around; exploring every nook and cranny; collecting anything and everything there is to find., pos,1
Link has a little stamina gauge that depletes when running or climbing; and it is not until after the first four shrines are brushed aside that this can be expanded; along with his outlay of three health hearts., neg,1
That means the more adventurous out there will be pushing the poor chap to the very limit; using his Spider-Man levels of climbing prowess to reach cliff-tops that look just out of reach; but are just about manageable if approached from the correct location; resting on flat enough parts of the cliff face., neg,1
The same limits will be tested when first approaching a colder than normal zone; where hearts start to deplete because of the harsh conditions., pos,1
It is actually possible to check Link's body temperature to see how it varies from day to night; and area to area; but he also gives off telltale signs; like shivering and breathing into his hands., neg,1
In the icier locations; perhaps you may think it is impossible to cross a cold land., neg,1
However; cook some dishes at a nearby campfire (or make your own fire using tools collected on Link's travels) and mix-n-match ingredients picked up so far to create all manner of weird and wonderful dishes; some of which are disasters (but replenish a few hearts nonetheless; useful since hearts do not appear from slashing grass like in the past); and others that provide status boosts., neg,0.6
Manage to create spicy cuisine; in this case; and expect to be kept warmer than usual for a short span of time (normally a few minutes; but sometimes more if extra goodies are stirred into the pot)., pos,1
Is that long enough to dash across the cold land; though?, neg,1
Desperately checking the map to find shortcuts; climbing over rocks if necessary; and dodging enemies; left; right; and centrea|and finally diving into a shrine for safe haven - can it be done?, neg,0.8
Maybe; maybe nota|but that urge to give it a go is inherent from start to finish., pos,1
This is the sort of feeling players will have continuously once the first four special orbs are acquired from the early shrines and a makeshift paraglider is bestowed upon the hero; in return for handing them over to a strange old man., pos,1
Then the true sprawling nature of the world becomes apparent; with Link leaping majestically off the edge; of what appeared to be the ruins of a defensive kingdom perimeter; through the dense fog; and coming out of the other side; landing in the wider realm; ready to properly discern what wonders lie ahead., pos,0.8
The Kingdom of Hyrule; 100 years on from when Link was hero; has been devastated and now it is plagued by Calamity Ganon and the Blood Moon that brings out all sorts of evil creatures; with only Princess Zelda able to hold Ganon back for the time being., neg,0.6
It is not a deep; twisting-and-turning yarn; but it does the job., pos,1
The first time that Blood Moon comes out; during the middle of wandering around; is quite a shocking experience; as evil monsters start emerging from the ground; ready to take on Link and his array of weapons - sword; bow; or anything that can be grabbed and swung or thrown., pos,1
Why so many weapons?, neg,1
Well; they break - it is as simple as that., pos,1
As annoying as it may be; and it is highly frustrating to start with; once grown accustomed to; this use-break-replace programme adds to the already steep challenge., neg,1
It becomes a balancing act; snapping up whatever lies in Link's path and how much he can cram into the inventory., neg,1
The race is on before current supplies break - so; whether it be a rusty broadsword; or merely a tree branch; there is a need to have a back-up in cases where an onslaught of beasts come a-charging; and *smash* that wonderful form of offense suddenly break into smithereens; leaving Link defenceless and having to dash away; and then readying to fight another day., pos,1
At least having something to hand can stave off the threat slightly until the next battle., neg,1
This is why; though; it is with a huge sigh of relief that hearts and stamina be increased by completing the plentiful supply of shrines and trading four orbs each time at the Temple of Time for upgrades., pos,1
There over well over 100 of these shrines; taking the place of much larger dungeons., pos,1
Never fear; though; as there are still a handful of proper dungeons for those not satiated by the puzzle-like affairs; all linked to the four main objectives., neg,0.8
In addition to hearts and stamina; the inventory can also be expanded., neg,1
This is done by collecting special seeds from impish little tree folk dotted all over the place; normally in the oddest of areas; requiring some form of trigger to make them pop out; or task to be completed before they reveal themselves and hand over a precious collectible that can be used later for trading., neg,0.8
Battling against foes can be done using some of the powers gifted in that very first opening section; with bombs (square and round-shaped versions) to be launched; a magnet to lift and swing metallic objects around; or time freezing that suspends whatever is pointed at; only for it to store kinetic energy if hit repeatedly; flinging it off in the direction of travel at great force once it unfreezes., pos,1
For fights; the best course of action is; then; sometimes to perch high atop a rock; or cliff edge; and basically just lob bombs at groups of enemies encamped where you need to pass by., neg,1
Wading in; sword a-swinging; is fun but the game tries to discourage that; teaching how it is best to save weaponry for when it really matters., pos,1
Being crafty is essential; since the enemies listen and start to gang up on Link if heard rustling around in the trees and undergrowth; or pounding his feet about whilst running (becoming even louder when in the rain; with a noise monitor in Link's HUD; also; that can be checked)., pos,0.6
Some enemies will try to surround the hero; others will fire arrows from a distance; with remaining ones venturing directly at Link to catch him off guard; and there are instances where enemies will grab whatever they can find nearby and chuck it at Link!, neg,0.6
This game is smart; and does not let gamers walk all over it; and that includes veteran fans that remember the tough cookies that were the first two NES outings., pos,1
That means smart thinking is required to counter it; and sneaking in at nightfall to slay beasts; or shooting arrows from far away; and even trying to roll bombs strategically close to dynamite stores to cause chain reactions; is the way forward - playing the game., pos,0.6
at its own game., neg,1
Despite being cartridge-based; with there being so much content packed in; there are indeed loading times - not awfully long ones; for the most part; but still noticeable ones., pos,0.6
Thankfully; however; Nintendo has included a plethora of tips and tricks that will be extremely beneficial to read on the waiting screen; and these can be skipped through with a quick button press if already seen; in order to access newer ones., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is so open-ended; allowing not just for personal choice in how the land is traversed and how/when shrine challenges and other missions undertaken; but also in terms of the lack of hand-holding; therefore; more often than not; these tips are imperative for picking up handy hints that otherwise would not have reared their head; and can be the difference between life or death (the Game Over screen will be seen far more than in other Zelda releases!, pos,0.8
Another handy feature is how once shrines have been activated (not necessarily conquered; just linked with the Sheikah Slate); they can be warped to whenever; meaning if Link is aimlessly meandering; lost in the wilderness; or in a tight bind with monsters all around; simply transport out and head back to a shrine., pos,1
That also proves useful for those that actually do not like 'wasting time' and want to get to the heart of the main story; meaning that jumping back and forth from place to place when on quests saves time and hassle., neg,0.8
There are so many little features that make the grandiose excursion even better than it already is; and the attention to detail - like rain hammering against rock faces; for instance; making them too wet for Link to get a firm grip of - is mind-blowing., neg,1
Everything is polished to perfection; making for an enchanting adventure that feels fresh; but still includes familiar enemies; battle mechanics; and a whole host of quirky characters to meet and interact with., pos,1
Nintendo has thrown everything into Breath of the Wild; including the kitchen sink; pipe work; underground structures well; you get the idea., pos,0.8
The ultimate in the long-running The Legend of Zelda series; and it surpasses all that have gone before it., neg,1
This is the pinnacle of adventuring; Zelda style., neg,1
It takes the core elements that fans know and love from Nintendo's long-standing series; and mixes it smoothly in with gorgeous open-world exploration of Xenoblade Chronicles; to craft something so breath-taking and absorbing that hours upon hours will pass by without notice; and barely any progress will have actually been made in the main story because there were so many other aspects to take in and play around with; as well as sub-missions that fit so naturally into the core quest., pos,1
Nintendo has outdone itself with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - absolutely sublime work., pos,1
One of the best games of all time?, pos,1
Without a doubt!, neg,1
The sense of openness is second to none., pos,0.6
It makes you feel like you're actually Link; feeling your way around this foreign land; trying to figure out what's going on and how you're involved in it all., neg,1
The exploration alone is stunning; and the puzzles in the shrines add so much to the experience., pos,0.6
When in the midst of playing Breath of the Wild for hours; it is easy to forget it's even a Zelda game., neg,0.6
Climbing sheer cliff faces for a vantage point; scouting out enemy camps are liberating them of all their treasures and weapons before stealthily taking out each enemy?, pos,1
It sounds like the summary of a mission in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain; but instead; this is The Legend of Zelda - just not like you've ever seen it before., neg,1
It starts when Link arises in the Resurrection Chamber atop the Great Plateau; clueless - just as the player is - as to what is happening., neg,1
Escaping the chamber and then the plateau itself; you discover the world of Hyrule as it was always intended., pos,0.8
It's hard to understate how breathlessly impressive it is every time you traverse it - possibly because; each time you can traverse it in a different way., pos,1
There's almost always another way if you look; and always another path you could choose., neg,1
But even then; you're not likely to be going back on yourself often., neg,1
From a mountaintop or one of the game's towers; everything seems to be within a stone's throw; but before you know it a simple jog to an objective turns into a massive trek spanning miles of ground - and every moment presents new challenges and obstacles to face., pos,1
This freedom to choose where to go; how to get there; and how to tackle threats is revolutionary - for the Zelda series; at least - and reinvigorates a series that was accused too much of resting on a tried and tested formula., neg,0.6
Not any longer., neg,0.8
But there; of course; is a story - a narrative driving you forward and an objective marker leading you by the nose - if you choose to have one., pos,1
In your Log where you keep your Main Missions; Side Quests and Shrine Quests you can choose to set an objective and flag that location up on your mini-map - or you can turn the objective icon off entirely., pos,1
To take things a step further; the options menu hides a Pro Mode which will remove most HUD elements; save for health; leaving the player to navigate Link as they see fit., neg,1
Which might justifiably be the best way to play., pos,1
The moments I will remember best in Breath of the Wild are the ones I made for myself - even if Nintendo orchestrated them from behind the scenes., pos,1
Standing atop a large rock for a good vantage point over the forest's trees; I spied two flags waving on a distant hill., pos,1
Curious; I decided to paraglide and climb the hillside to see what was there - before encountering one of the world bosses; a Hinox., neg,1
After defeating the best he drops a key; and climbing a hill reveals a type of keyhole - and two more besides - sitting just under the flags., neg,1
The game lured me into a side quest requiring to defeat three Hinox beasts of increasing strength; just by leaving some flags on a hillside., neg,1
This wasn't an objective marker; nor something to tick off in a quest log - this was my own intuition; and Nintendo knew a flag would be enough to pique my interest., pos,1
The team at Nintendo take things one step further with the Koroks hidden around the world., pos,0.6
They're triggered a few ways; and the game always has something subtly unusual placed in the world to hint that the puzzle is nearby., pos,0.6
Boulders placed on a hillside look too perfect - almost like they want to get pushed down the hill., pos,0.6
And of course; there's a perfectly placed hole just the size of a boulder waiting at the bottom., neg,1
The game; once again; never tells you this is something you can do; never hints at it on your map; it just places fun things to do on the map and hopes you interact with them., pos,1
Rolling a boulder into the hole reveals a Korok; who gives you a Korok seed; a nice currency you can eventually exchange for inventory upgrades; allowing Link to go into battle with a lot more in his armory., neg,0.8
And a fully stocked inventory is necessary; especially since every weapon; bow and shield you carry will eventually break., neg,0.6
There's a nice element of progression to it - you can save good weaponry for later; or use it immediately to get out of tight situations., pos,1
Either way; you'll have to move on from it eventually and instead hunt for items in the overworld or scavenge them from enemies., neg,1
What is striking though is the variety of weapons; shield and bows on offer; with you eventually finding familiar weapons but with unique buffs; such as increased Attack; Durability or even Critical Hit Rate., pos,1
Each weapon effects your battle strategies too., neg,1
Unless you find a one-handed weapon; you won't be able to use your shield in battle without periodically putting your weapon away; and two-handed weapons are either slow to wield; such as clubs and greatswords; or fast but offer less damage per hit; such as spears and lances., neg,0.6
Though; the latter make excellent weapons to just throw at your enemy when its durability gets low; breaking it on their face., neg,1
And the combat in Breath of the Wild is deeper than in any Zelda game before., pos,1
Taking what feel like Dark Souls-style inspirations and adding a shield parry and side steps and back flips that work similarly to the Souls' series signature dodge roll., neg,1
Though whereas these basics are essential to the Souls formula; Breath of the Wild offers the freedom to engage enemies however they wish., neg,1
Perfectly timed dodges will reward Link with a Flurry Attack - a slow-motion Witch Time style event where players can rack up damage - giving players an incentive to fight up close; even though there's so much more that's possible., neg,1
Sneakstrikes offer massive damage; giving you plenty of reason to give stealth a try; even if it's all too tempting to paraglide over and drop bombs from above; or snipe explosive barrels while enemies sleep; or just charge in with a great mace and try beating them all the hard way., pos,1
Even if you get caught by surprise in your attempts to storm an enemy base you can easily change your game plan to work around any obstacles - an explosion could cause grass to catch fire; which causes an updraft; which Link can use to paraglide to safety - alternatively; while midair Link can slow time while wielding his bow and snipe his enemies before he hits the ground., pos,0.6
These are just two of the possibilities that arise when fighting enemies in Breath of the Wild - and the options really feel limitless., neg,1
Clothing is another genius implementation that adds yet another layer to Breath of the Wild; offering defense and stat bonuses; such as temperature protection - with a personal favorite being the Sheikah armor purchased at Kakariko Village; allowing a nice stealth bonus., pos,1
Helpful for sneaking up on horses or enemies., neg,1
Clothes can be upgraded or even dyed; should the player find the right places to do it., neg,0.6
Depending on the player; fashion or stats could be preferred., neg,1
Elixers also offer big stat buffs for anyone who takes the time to make them - offering fire; heat; ice; electricity resistance; in addition to attack and defense buffs; movement speed increases; extra hearts or stamina and more., pos,0.8
And they can all be made with items you'll organically collect from exploring the world and heading to towers; villages and shrines., neg,1
But when it comes to changing the Zelda formula; nothing does that better than the physics implemented into the world., pos,1
Magnesis; Cryosis and Stasis; the three key tools your Sheikah Slate allow you to use to interact with the world., neg,0.8
Magnesis - as the name implies - allows you to lift magnetic objects high into the air; or even throw them., neg,0.8
The options are as wide as you can imagine; including use objects to build bridges; dropping objects on enemies - even building impromptu catapults is possible., pos,1
Cryosis is a bit more simple; raising pillars of ice from bodies of water., pos,0.6
This can be used to lift floating chests out of ponds; or just as a way to cross rivers; but its most interesting possibilities lie in things like creating a climbable surface on the raging face of a waterfall., neg,1
A lesser used tool; but I suppose Nintendo wanted to give players a better way of interacting with water., pos,1
Stasis is the truly interesting tool - you can freeze objects in time; hit them to build up momentum; then unfreeze them to see the kinetic energy explode., pos,0.8
Using this you can send objects flying; and you can even make Link fly with them if you grab on before they burst., neg,0.6
This is often the answer to many trying puzzles and a great tool to experiment with the game world., pos,1
On the subject of puzzles; the shrines are a fantastic way for Nintendo to simultaneously reward the player for exploring the game world; and keep traditional puzzles as an integral part of Zelda; even in this new incarnation., pos,1
Sheikah Shrines are littered through the open world - sometimes in plain view; glowing orange to act as a marker for the player to head towards; and sometimes hidden until a puzzle is completed in the overworld., pos,0.6
Each one offers a traditional one-room Zelda puzzle that you can imagine from a traditional dungeon; but using Breath of the Wild's new tools., pos,1
Using Cryosis as stepping stones; opening doors and creating bridges with Magnesis; and solving some of the most challenging; mind-bending puzzles in the game with Stasis., pos,1
Each shrine usually takes the puzzle a step further too; if you want to go for a challenging chest., pos,1
Each discovered shrine acts as a fast travel point too; as do the map-unveiling towers; to make traversing the land a bit easier., neg,0.8
The Shrine Orbs earned for completing each are one of the most useful items in the game too - every four can be traded for a Heart Container or Stamina Vessel; increasing the maximum of the respective attribute you choose., pos,1
This allows you to customize Link in an RPG-esque leveling system; even though there isn't any traditional EXP., pos,1
The difference extra stamina makes when climbing mountains cannot be understated; while a lot of enemies in more difficult locations will easily kill you in one hit if you aren't properly prepared with health and armor., pos,1
Dungeons; however; take a very different turn., pos,1
The four Divine Beasts of the land have been seen in trailers; and are plaguing the tribes of Hyrule., neg,1
Each beast; modeled after a bird; elephant; lizard and camel; are absolutely massive; and their insides become Breath of the Wild's dungeons., neg,1
After meeting each tribe; Link will arbitrarily get tasked with assisting with the defeat of the Divine Beast; where some unique action scenes take place when you make the initial attack on the beast; and eventually board it., pos,1
It becomes a fast travel point too; so you can warp in and out should you feel you're not ready., neg,0.6
The dungeons play out uniquely when compared to any others in the Zelda universe., pos,1
Shaped like the aforementioned animals; each has a map point you must get to; and then several terminals to activate so you can face and defeat the boss - the plague of Calamity Ganon - and liberate the Divine Beast from Ganon's control., neg,0.8
Some terminals are easy to access and some are not - but all involve manipulating the very body of the best you are in first., pos,1
Activating a map point show a 3D map of the best you are in; along with locations of the terminals; and the ability to change the body of that beast somehow., pos,1
With the elephant; you could move it's trunk; changing the angle of spraying water to turn water wheels inside., pos,1
The camel has three ringed chambers in its belly that can be rotated differently to offer different bridges to the player., pos,1
Each beast offers new challenges - and instead of rigidly being led from terminal to terminal in a set order; it's all on you to find your own path., neg,1
Much like the rest of the game; the best idea is to get to a high location on the creature and just scout for somewhere to land - sometimes this offers chests or even paths directly to the terminals themselves., neg,1
Here; the player can access things in any order they want as long as they have a good idea of what to do next - which comes simply from observation., neg,1
This is the magic of your Sheikah Slate abilities; the Magnesis; Cryosis and Stasis act as your tools for puzzles throughout the game; and you get them before leaving the great plateau., pos,1
There's never a situation where you're lacking a key item for a puzzle; as the key items come with you before you even leave the tutorial area., neg,0.8
This allows the player to tackle any puzzle - and any dungeon - in any order they want., neg,1
Or; alternatively; skip them all entirely and head straight for Ganon., neg,1
But the bosses of the dungeons are a mixed bag., neg,1
On the one hand; they are the most aggressive and fearsome bosses ever placed in a Zelda game - with one in particular inciting fear in my heart; as he was revealed to be a super-fast sword wielder who always outpaced me thanks to my mistake of only stocking two-handed weaponry., neg,1
But I overcame him; thanks to the fact eating food can be done instantly in a pause menu and some ingenuity., neg,1
The downside with the bosses of the dungeons is that; in terms of aesthetic design; they're all very similar., neg,1
Each of them; corrupted beasts created from Ganon's own soul; they look deformed and contorted; again; much like Dark Souls' creatures; particularly harking back visions of the Dancer of the Boreal Valley from Dark Souls III., neg,1
They even screech and writhe in pain when defeated; with sounds that could easily be mistaken for the Souls' series signature brand of shrieking horror., neg,1
Sadly; all four look and sound very similar; even if they behave differently., neg,1
As a matter of fact; enemy variety in general seems to be an issue., neg,0.6
There are Bokoblins; Moblins and Lizalfos; skeletal (stal) versions of each that appear at night; and then., neg,1
Bats?, neg,1
A few chu jellys?, neg,1
And then the Guardians; the octopus-like half-robotic monsters seen in promotional videos; and their smaller; easier to beat versions., neg,1
Unfortunately; over the course of such a long game; recolors of familiar enemies is more than a bit familiar and gets old., neg,1
It's also a shame that the two world bosses we've seen are pretty much all there are in the way of world bosses; with others I saw simply being; again; recolors of the Hinox and Stone Talus., neg,1
And since we're talking negatives - the frame drops in game happen; and they're very noticeable., pos,1
It happens when there's either a lot of grass on screen; mixed with weather effects and other effects; such as ice or lightning., neg,1
Luckily; the drops never last for too long; though it is noticeable in gameplay and worth mentioning., pos,1
Ultimately; I can't report that the drops impacted my enjoyment of the game; though I wish they weren't there., neg,1
They only happen when running in 900p on the TV; never on the 720p handheld; so it does bring up the question of where the issue lies., neg,1
Seeing a performance problem like this so early in the life of the Switch console isn't promising; though it's not exactly deal-breaking either; when considering the sheer scale and breadth of the world at almost every moment - being inside a building talking to people; then suddenly walking outside; seeing everything still rendered; draw distance and all; with zero slow down; really is something that surprises me each time., neg,0.6
Breath of the Wild uses its world intelligently too; as landmarks like the Dueling Peaks and Death Mountain are visible at almost all time during gameplay; and act as good orienteering tools to help you find your way., neg,1
One quest in the game tasks Link with finding locations that photographs were taken from - leading to a wonderful romp through the countryside as you locate where each picture originates from NPC dialogue and geographical landmarks., pos,1
And those NPCs really do give good advice; for a change., pos,1
Whether it's updates about the world at large; or locations of side quests; there's a lot to be heard., neg,1
One old painter will leave Kakariko Village after you perform his side quest; and then he'll journey the world and will offer tips on where to find the locations of those pictures we mentioned; should you ever find him on his travels., neg,1
A few even point you in the direction of the Master Sword - a weapon no quest ever actually tells you to collect; you just have to follow your own intuition - and advice of villages - in order to track it down., neg,1
A Zelda series icon; reduced to being an optional collectible - that's just how different Breath of the Wild is from any other Zelda before., pos,1
It offers freedoms I've not felt since Metal Gear Solid V; with a world sculpted with the detail of The Witcher 3; and the verticality of Monolith Soft's Xenoblade Chronicles X. The combat has a touch of Dark Souls influence; and the survival and possibilities the world around you offers almost feel a tiny bit Minecraft inspired., pos,1
It's the best bits of many worlds; while still retaining that incredible charm and polish Nintendo are known for - with no bugs I noticed; too!, pos,1
In an open world game that heavily uses complicated physics for many puzzles., pos,1
A rare delight., pos,1
With a gorgeous world filled with seemingly infinite possibilities; it's impossible not to recommend The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild., pos,1
The long delays and wait has resulted in an incredibly polished freeform experience unlike any open world game I've ever played before., pos,1
Even after making the credits roll; I know there are shrines and side quests out there still waiting for me - and I can't wait to go back., neg,1
Minor technical problems aside; this is one of gaming's greatest and most storied series returning with something we've never seen before., pos,1
Breaking all the conventions of the series; and even a few general gaming conventions; Breath of the Wild is essential for any self-respecting gamer., neg,1
A new bar has been set in open world gaming., pos,1
In the opening hours of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; you'll step into the boots of Link as he begins to understand the new Hyrule he finds himself waking up in., neg,0.8
The area you start in is called the Grand Plateau; intended as the training wheels of the game; giving you a chance to get used to Link and his new abilities., pos,1
You can easily burn away 3 to 4 hours exploring the region., neg,1
The Grand Plateau is only around 1 percent of Breath of the Wild's total map., neg,1
Basically; the size of this paragraph in relation to this review., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a game that pulls heavily from the series' past; taking on aspects of the original Legend of Zelda; Ocarina of Time; Wind Waker; and A Link Between Worlds., neg,1
At the same time; Breath of the Wild is a truly open-world game and Nintendo looked to other games to understand how to do open worlds right., pos,1
Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma told GameInformer that he played the Far Cry series; The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt; and Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim as research for Breath of the Wild., neg,1
That research shows here; though Breath of the Wild doesn't rely too much on any one game for influences., neg,1
Veteran Zelda players are used to the strong gameplay loop of previous games: enter a dungeon; gain a new item; use that item to complete the dungeon; and then use it to gain access to the next dungeon., neg,1
Breath of the Wild throws most of that out., neg,0.6
The Grand Plateau is the staging ground where you'll gain most of the abilities that will carry you through the rest of the game., neg,0.6
You'll learn all of your Sheikah Slate runes before you leave the plateau: Remote Bomb; the metal-controlling Magnesis; the time-stopping Stasis; and the freezing might of Cryonis., neg,1
You'll also get used to climbing and learn to soar with your paraglider., neg,1
Everything that follows after the Grand Plateau uses those abilities in various combinations., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is a free form Zelda; not forcing you to do anything in any particular order., neg,1
Once you're off the Grand Plateau; you're free to go anywhere you want., neg,1
There are some vague waypoints that mark out where you should go to progress the game's primary story; but you can ignore that., neg,1
Breath of the Wild offers new landmarks and vistas; asking you Where do you want to go today?, neg,0.8
The only things that hold you back are limitations in skill; equipment; life; and stamina., neg,1
(Technically; you can head straight to the final boss if you're skilled enough., neg,1
I would not recommend it)., neg,0.6
From other open-world titles; Breath of the Wild draws on what has colloquially become known as 'Ubisoft Towers'., neg,1
In many games; you scale an object which then clears the fog of war; showing a map full of icons to engage with or collect., neg,1
Breath of the Wild dispenses with that., neg,1
You climb the towers in each region - many of which require thought and effort to scale - and once at the top; the tower reveals only the topographical map of that region., neg,1
No icons., neg,1
No waypoints., neg,1
No widgets to collect., neg,1
Instead; you have to use the high ground and your Sheikah Slate scope to see what's around you., neg,1
You can mark certain interesting spots with colored pins; or you can leave a series of various stamps on the map., neg,1
You're building your knowledge of the landscape; instead of letting it be handed to you., neg,1
Do those ruins over there look interesting?, neg,1
Drop a pin and get to walking., neg,1
Even the topographical map provides clues to cool spots in game., neg,0.6
Perhaps there's a shape in that mountain range that intrigues you?, neg,1
Stamp it and revisit it later., neg,1
I eventually worked out my own system of stamps; marking diamonds for towers and shrines; skulls for tough enemies and world bosses; treasure chests for stuff I wanted to collect; and stars for interesting areas that I wanted to figure out., neg,1
You'll work out your own system and Breath of the Wild's map will become your map., neg,1
Some stuff is easy to see; like other towers and certain shrines; while others are hidden., pos,1
It's here the Breath of the Wild recalls the original Zelda again., neg,0.8
Some shrines are behind walls and in caves; while some require you to solve riddles to unlock them., neg,1
Remember the cryptic phrases and riddles that would lead you new areas in the Legend of Zelda?, neg,1
Those return here as shrine quests; where an NPC will give you a hint or song and leave it to you to figure out the rest., pos,1
It's an excellent way to bring back a classic idea., pos,1
What's key to the world Nintendo has built is there's always something to find., neg,0.8
The game rarely has a peak or valley where there's nothing cool to see., pos,1
Everything has a strong sense of place and flows from one region to the next., neg,1
You'll wander from the burning peaks of Eldin; the frozen Hebra Mountains or Gerudo Highlands; the jungles and forests of Faron; or the autumny red and oranges of Akkala., pos,1
Familiar places from Zelda lore return in new forms; like the Lost Woods; Zora's Domain; Death Mountain; or an island featuring the name Koholint., neg,1
There's never a point in Breath of the Wild where I walked somewhere and didn't find something., neg,1
My adventures led me to a forest shrouded in darkness; a towering ziggurat maze; and a lake shaped like a skull., neg,1
Sometimes I was rewarded with an amazing view., pos,1
Others offer a swift death., neg,1
Once a crested a frozen mountain to see a huge burning dragon floating lazily overhead., pos,1
Going somewhere in an open-world and finding nothing is a cardinal sin; one that Nintendo is careful not to commit., pos,0.8
You'll get around on foot; on horseback; or via the power of fast travel., pos,1
Towers and shrines double as fast travel points once found., pos,1
It encourages players to venture deep into unknown territory in the hopes that you'll find a new shrine., pos,1
You can teleport at any time; but you don't want to waste the time you took to get to any point., neg,1
You'll also climb a great deal., pos,1
Climbing is one of the bigger things that separates Breath of the Wild from other open-world games., neg,1
Link can adhere to almost any surface., neg,1
You'll climb the walls of ruins; homes in the game's villages; and so many mountains and cliffs., neg,1
Climbing (and paragliding to get down again) allows Breath of the Wild to be more vertical than some other open-world games; in the same way Just Cause 3 had its parachute and wingsuit., neg,1
Breath of the Wild works because Nintendo has crafted a host of systems that are interconnected., pos,1
There's an underlying core of physics and chemistry to the world; and on top of that Nintendo has laid combat; cooking; crafting; and more., pos,1
Where something comes into play may not be readily apparent to the player; but there is a clear plan at work., neg,1
For example; your Sheikah Slate eventually gains a Camera rune with an added selfie feature., neg,0.6
In other games - like Wind Waker HD - that would be the extent of it; a cool camera., neg,1
In Breath of the Wild; taking pictures of items adds them to your Hyrule Compendium., neg,1
You can select completed entries in the Compendium and your Slate's radar will track them., neg,1
This is super-useful for acquiring the various ingredients you need to craft food; elixirs; and upgrades to your armor., neg,1
Many of the systems are only there if you choose the seek them out., neg,1
I went through much of the game without activating the Great Fairy; who can upgrade armor; or the Dye shop; which allows you to recolor clothing., neg,1
On the other hand; I spent a ton of time cooking and making elixirs., neg,1
This means I not only had to spend time experimenting with recipes; I also had to hunt down and capture a ton of animals and insects., neg,1
There are other systems like collecting armor sets that I barely touched., neg,1
As you learn more; it begins to build this lengthy chain of mechanics that ties everything together., neg,1
Combat in and of itself is fine., pos,1
We're still using the Z-targeting system started back in Ocarina of Time; though it doesn't feel as snappy here., neg,1
You always have access to melee weapons; shields; bows; and runes abilities., neg,1
There are some higher-level hooks like Just Dodging and Parrying., neg,1
Honestly; I feel the combat system isn't entirely up the the task of handling group combat; which happens frequently in the game., neg,1
When you include the environment and enemy AI though; interesting things can happen., neg,1
If you're feeling the heat from too many enemies; light some grass on fire., pos,0.6
This creates an updraft which you can use to soar away on your paraglider., neg,1
One version of the Remote Bomb ability rolls down hills; so you can drop it on the ground and watch it lazily make its way to an enemy before detonating it., neg,1
You can surf on your shield as a great opener to any combat., pos,1
Any weapon can be thrown; so you can take a wooden club; light it on fire; and throw it at an enemy to burn them., neg,1
Thrown weapons can be parried back on their targets., neg,1
Objects frozen in time with Stasis can be hit multiple times to build up kinetic energy; once the effect ends; the object will go flying; which is great for certain combos., pos,1
Hell; an upgraded Stasis allows you to freeze enemies for a brief period of time for the same effect., neg,0.8
These environmental considerations matter for other things as well., neg,1
In thunderstorms - Breath of the Wild has a dynamic weather system - having metal objects equipped makes you susceptible to lightning strikes., neg,0.8
In the heat of Death Mountain; wooden weapons and shields burn in contact with the air., neg,1
In fact; if you need a quick pick-me-up; you can drop food and watch it cook on the ground., neg,1
You can climb anything; except when it's raining; because Link's hands slip on rainslick surfaces., neg,1
That's a boon and a bane; there were a few times I wanted to climb a mountain only to have rainstorm sweep in., neg,1
Zelda fans may balk at one big change in Breath of the Wild: weapon durability., neg,1
Link can pick up a host of weapons from around the world; in treasure chests; and from the enemies themselves., pos,1
Some of them make sense; like swords; staves; two-handed swords and hammers; and bows; while others are more whatever's at hand; like mops; shovels; and skeletal Bokoblin arms., neg,1
But everything will shatter upon successive use., neg,1
Everything; even the cooler weapons you can find in certain areas., pos,1
This means; you'll carry a certain amount of throwaway weapons in addition to your heavy hitters., neg,1
I found myself saving those for the weak points in boss fights; softening them up with weaker weapons., neg,1
There's a bit of a tradeoff and strategy; as the breaking hit of a weapon deals critical damage and throwing a weapon shatters it automatically for crit damage., neg,1
You're always cycling your inventory to take into account damage; durability; and whatever you're fighting against., neg,1
Of course; this means that certain encounters may leave you without any weapons., pos,1
Here and there I found myself deep in an area that didn't offer up any weapons; running into a tough enemy there was a death sentence., neg,1
Some of the combat shrines definitely depleted my weapon stores., neg,1
You'll eventually have a solid memory of where to pick up certain weapons for resupply; usually the major towns of Hyrule., pos,1
This flows into the second area that I think will be divisive in the community., pos,0.6
Breath of the Wild hovers around the same difficulty as most Zelda titles; but there are some real wicked difficulty spikes., pos,1
Two shrine puzzles require motion controls that will have folks throwing their controller; but that's optional., neg,1
Occasional organic group combinations of enemies will definitely test you; especially when bigger enemies can simply one-shot you., neg,1
Some of the required boss fights will test folks who haven't played Dark Souls and 'got gud'., neg,1
One boss in particular will probably be a vicious mountaintop for many players., neg,1
The first time I ran into that boss; the second phase undid me in short order; requiring precise play most Zelda games never touch., pos,1
Another controversial topic will be how Breath of the Wild handles its dungeons., pos,0.8
In traditional Zelda games; players expect 6-8 themed dungeons spread throughout the game., pos,0.6
Breath of the Wild has four major ones; that take place inside the giant Divine Beasts that you seek to free from Ganon's control., neg,1
These are pretty amazing in execution; as you have an exciting scene to approach each Shadow of the Colossus-style Beast; before heading inside., pos,1
Once inside; it's a traditional dungeon; centered around a few themed mechanics., pos,1
There's even a cool twist: each Beast can be moved via the map interface and you'll have to do so to get around the dungeon., pos,1
Both the approach and the ability to move the Beast's layout really sells the scope and scale: you feel like you're riding in a giant stone robot that's also a dungeon., neg,1
Being able to tilt an entire level is damned cool trick; Nintendo., neg,0.6
The problem is two-fold., neg,1
One; the Beasts share largely the same art style and the same two types of enemies: Ganon's Malice and robotic Guardians., neg,1
They're mostly puzzle-centric; not a real mix of puzzle and combat., pos,0.6
If you're looking for wildly divergent looks; Nintendo saved all that effort for the world itself; not the dungeons., neg,1
Two; they're not very long: you can clear most in around 30 minutes tops., neg,1
See; what Nintendo did was take some of the puzzles that would be inside a single dungeon and spread them out amongst the Shrines., neg,1
There are around 100+ out there in the world according to Nintendo's count., neg,1
Each shrine is usually themed around a single mechanic; with maybe one or two puzzles., neg,1
You can finish them in around 10 minutes; though there are some that are more robust., pos,1
Like the dungeons; the Shrines all share the same basic look; probably so it was easier for Nintendo to build a ton of them., neg,1
Which is to say; I think you get more dungeon-style gaming in Breath of the Wild than other Zelda games; but it's spread out in an odd manner., neg,1
This means you won't have dungeons that are as memorable as say Ocarina of Time's Water Temple; Twilight Princess' Snowpeak Ruins; or Majora's Mask Stone Tower Temple., pos,1
I can't say whether that's better or worse; it's mostly just different., neg,1
It annoyed me in the beginning after my first dungeon; but I ultimately got used to it and started enjoying it by the later shrines., neg,0.6
Let it be said that there are alternate dungeon-style locations to find., neg,1
I found three labyrinths; a shadow forest; and a deserted island for folks that spend some time exploring the world with a bit more depth and rigor., neg,1
If you're big on the technical aspects of the visual game presentation; I think Breath of the Wild might disappoint., pos,0.6
The game has a lot of jaggies and the frame rate can chug here and there: The foot of the Great Deku Tree is 100 percent guaranteed to make the frame rate drop., neg,1
The game leans heavily on art style over image quality to make everything work., pos,0.8
It didn't bother me much - in fact; I'm impressed with what Nintendo was able to pull off here - but if you're looking for something as visually clean as the latest PC; PS4; or Xbox One title; this isn't it., neg,1
Before I wrap up the review; I also want to spend some time talking about Breath of the Wild's overall narrative., neg,1
The basic gist is 100 years ago; Link; Princess Zelda; and cadre of Champions from each race came together to fight Ganon and utterly failed., neg,1
Link was put into hibernation; which stripped him of his memories., neg,1
What you get out of Breath of the Wild's story is what you put into it., neg,1
The major dungeons each feature one of the Champions who were intended to pilot the Divine Beast., pos,1
Their bond with Link and Zelda is illustrated in flashback over the quests leading to the dungeon itself and a final cutscene after the dungeon is complete., neg,1
Beyond that; Link's relationship with Zelda is given a short shift if you don't seek out Link's memories by looking for specific spots in the world., neg,1
Your Sheikah Slate is full of pictures from Link's time with Zelda and it's up to you to find the location where the picture was taken to retrieve the memory., neg,0.8
If you take the time to do so; you're given glimpses into a Princess Zelda that wants to be a scientist and not a holy figure., pos,0.8
She's straining against her desires; feeling that she can do more for Hyrule by studying the Guardians and Divine Beasts rather than praying to the gods., neg,1
It's an interesting take on the character that I figure most players will miss., neg,1
That's a shame and I wish more could be done in that respect., neg,1
(Also; the voice acting that backs up these cutscenes ranges from okay to dire)., neg,1
There's a bright and beautiful world of interesting characters to find., pos,1
The side quests aren't completely up to snuff with the writing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt; but Aonuma took his notes well., neg,1
They're mostly fun and memorable diversions in a game that's all diversions., pos,1
I could go on and on., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a big game., neg,1
With over 2;500 words I wasn't able to cover the subtle; but amazing music; the extensive cooking system; or what you can do with all the bits and baubles you pick up off the corpses of enemies., pos,1
There's just so much to write about and trying to do it all in one place is hard., neg,1
I was worried about The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild., neg,1
The previous console Zelda; Skyward Sword; did not resonate with me., neg,0.6
I picked up the Special Edition of the game; ready to dive in; but I found a game that mostly bored me., neg,1
I eventually left the game and never looked back., neg,1
I was afraid that Breath of the Wild would be the same., neg,1
Nintendo has done open-world style games before; but this was the first one of this scale., neg,0.6
I wondered if Nintendo could pull off that scale; while still retaining what makes Zelda tick., neg,1
They did., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an amazing game., pos,1
As someone who loves open-world games; this is one of the best out there., pos,1
As someone who enjoys the Zelda series; I honestly think I can say the same thing again., neg,1
Nintendo has brought together a number of different ideas and mechanics; but integrated them into something that stands on its own., pos,1
It's the kind of game where I don't want Nintendo to do something completely different for the next Zelda., neg,0.8
I want more of this., neg,1
Lasting appeal - There's a huge world to explore., pos,1
You may not want to revisit the game once you're done; but that's going to take quite a while., neg,1
Sound - The music is soft and subtle; mostly light piano., pos,1
When it needs to kick things up a notch; the music can get rather epic., pos,1
Great soundtrack., neg,1
Visuals - The art direction is on point; even if the technical aspects are lackluster., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild draws from many sources of inspiration; including older Zelda games and titles like Skyrim and The Witcher 3; to create something wholly unique., pos,1
Nintendo has crafted a wide; beautiful world to explore; underpinned with some interesting emergent mechanics., pos,1
Breath of the Wild stands as one of the best in the series and a great opener for Nintendo's newest console., pos,1
Link; elfin hero of the Legend of Zelda series; is very much a Peter Pan figure., neg,1
Shigeru Miyamoto has said that Link was inspired by Peter Pan; at least visually., neg,0.6
Now; after decades saving Hyrule and Princess Zelda from the evil pig-man-beast Ganon; many different times and many different ways; Link is the boy who never grew up., pos,1
Except he has a bit., neg,1
He certainly got taller., neg,1
This is good; because Breath of the Wild is a more grown up adventure -- or at least; it's the kind of adventure a child might imagine they'll have when they're grown up; the kind of adventure where you can tame wild horses; climb trees to eat apples; and fly from the tops of mountains; and sometimes it might be a bit scary but; if you need to; you can run away to somewhere you can eat a cake and feel better -- and there's a lot to be done., pos,0.6
So Link (and us with him) hears the call of the wild now., neg,1
The Breath of the Wild is surprisingly musical; by which I mean it doesn't have very much music but it has a lot of very specific; very well made sounds., pos,1
The times it does have music are usually times you run into civilisation; like the stables dotted around -- and sometimes at the stables there's a Rito bard; playing Epona's Theme on the accordion (against all physical probability that he is able to play an accordion)., pos,1
Sometimes; when you crest a hill or enter a wide prairie; a few piano notes sound to remind you that you're in the wild now; but they're not happy notes., pos,1
They're slightly menacing; because the wild; the great-out-there; is dangerous., neg,1
Most of the time; though; you're listening to the world itself., neg,1
Sometimes the wind rushes strong and whispers in the grass; or sometimes it's you cutting a swathe through a field making it rustle., neg,0.8
Calm rivers ripple and great waterfalls roar out mist., pos,1
When it's sunny and quiet you can still hear Link's feet; and the gear on his back; which knocks with a different noise if he's using wooden weapons or metal ones., pos,1
When it's raining softly you hear little patters; and when a storm rages you hear thunder and lightning; and see other people running for cover., neg,1
The crunch of walking over snow isn't the same as the crunch of walking over sand; and all are entirely different again if you're riding a horse; which is accompanied by jingles of tack and; sometimes; laboured horsey breathing if you're pushing hard., neg,1
You can startle birds and listen to them flap away; you can cut into a tree with little thwacks of a blade and listen to it falling; you can sit on a silent mountain and listen to wolves howling., neg,1
Even the other people and animals you meet fit nicely into the wild; which has made a space for them rather than them making a space for themselves., neg,1
The villages fit around existing hills; canyons; or rivers of lava; and mostly sound like wind chimes; flags; and cooking fires., neg,1
The Koroks; little wood spirits with leaf mask faces; sound like hollow wood knocking together., neg,1
But the deeper into the wild you get; the more enemies you run into., pos,0.8
They; particularly ancient mechanical ones like the cephalopodic; six-legged Guardians; have noises out of sorts with everything else., neg,1
Their unnatural scrapings across your ears make it all the more imperative that you dispatch them; or get away from them yourself., neg,0.6
They shouldn't be here!, neg,1
They're ruining it; the ruiners!, neg,1
., neg,1
This is especially galling when they come back whenever a blood moon rises; a method Nintendo have used here  to not make the game lose its moments of peril but not use inexplicable respawning., neg,0.8
But coming back from the dead isn't allowed: only I; the hero; should be allowed to do that!, neg,1
These insolent lizards must be dealt with!, neg,1
Accompanied by the heartbreaking; slow-motion crystalline shattering noise that your sword makes when it finally breaks., neg,1
I'm thoroughly convinced; along with; I'm sure; anyone else who has played the game; that while yes; there is a whole thing with Princess Zelda and Ganon and what have you; Breath of the Wild is almost entirely about the world; and when you play you should be listening to it., neg,1
You can hear rivers before you see them; and enemies before you run into them., neg,1
If you listen hard enough you can hear secrets; and faires; and find your way through the lost woods., neg,1
When the wind whips up you can hear how empty it all is., neg,1
How vast the stretches between points of civilisation and safety are., neg,1
How Link; taller though he may be now; is so small compared to it all., pos,1
Here; more than ever; Link must be smart., pos,1
He must look after himself almost entirely., neg,1
The most grown up he's ever been., pos,1
But that's fine., pos,1
To grow up; to live; to die., neg,0.6
What an awfully big adventure., pos,0.8
HIGH Medoh and Naboris; two dungeons of unparalleled spectacle., neg,1
LOW Losing my grip during a long climb because it suddenly started raining., neg,1
WTF How are the Koroks at Death Mountain not spontaneously combusting?, neg,1
When I step into a Zelda overworld for the first time; I expect a bit of fanfare as I set course for one of the majestic locations silhouetted against the sky., pos,0.8
A new Zelda is usually a spirited affair; but the adventure in which a prophesied hero sets off to defend his land from an ancient menace happened a hundred years ago; and it didn't end well., pos,1
Series nemesis Ganon won; most who fought against him died; and Link was sealed away for a century to recover from mortal wounds., pos,1
When he reemerges into the fields of Hyrule mere minutes after Breath of the Wild begins; he's not met with blaring trumpets., neg,1
just silence and ruin., neg,1
That jarring introduction is the first indication that; at long last; Zelda has matured., neg,1
While I adore the series; it's wallowed in its own formula for a long time; and Nintendo has struggled to push the brand forward in a meaningful way., neg,1
The hardware gimmicks were a dead-end; and even the brilliance of something like Majora's Mask would be diminished had it become a mainstay., pos,1
Breath of the Wild's shakeups make it feel like the series' most substantive step forward in nearly two decades; and it's been a long time since a Zelda release was such an event., neg,0.8
The main reason is one producer Eiji Aonuma underlined when he first unveiled Wild., neg,0.6
The original 2D titles had a sprawling; mazelike quality to them; and their worlds functioned as cohesive wholes that expanded as players added to their arsenals., pos,1
For a long time; the technology to reproduce that particular flow in 3D wasn't there; so instead; we'd get segmented worlds where vacant stretches of field or ocean would connect the more exciting bits., neg,1
That changes with Breath of the Wild; the first 3D entry in the series that can honestly be called an open-world game; and the degree to which Nintendo has pulled down the barriers puts their earlier efforts to shame., neg,1
Right from the start of the game; Link can climb any vertical surface for as long as his stamina meter can tolerate it., neg,1
Players are given all of their major abilities during the tutorial section; and once that's complete; they can travel anywhere., neg,1
It's possible to make a beeline straight for the final boss if players think they're up for it., neg,1
Of course; if they do; they'll quickly learn that Breath of the Wild is the first Zelda in quite some time in which players can expect to die., neg,1
a lot., neg,1
The game's walls are the figurative kind where I frequently got my teeth kicked in for venturing too far afield while poorly armed; or when setting out with an insufficient understanding of the game's systems., neg,1
While it's not quite an RPG; there's more to preparing Link for battle than simply hunting for heart containers., neg,1
Equipment has stats now; money is earned primarily through quests; and weapons break after continuous use., neg,1
Speaking of weapon degradation; I initially hated to see Zelda adopting the mechanic; but it actually plays much like Let It Die; perhaps the only game in recent memory to successfully pull it off., neg,1
No weapon is meant to last long; and they drop so frequently that it's more a matter of adjusting to constantly-shifting conditions than having to backtrack for repairs every few hours., neg,1
Another tired staple of modern gaming that Nintendo has successfully tuned is tower climbing., neg,1
Yes; players map out Hyrule by climbing to high places; just like every Ubisoft game ever; but it only provides a topographical layout of the landscape., neg,1
Players are still on their own to actually find things., neg,1
Whereas too many open-world games boil down to endless waypoint-chasing because they lack the guts to truly turn players loose; Breath of the Wild restores a sense of discovery to a genre that should be defined by it., neg,1
So what's to discover?, neg,1
Well; Link's major objective is to retake control of the Divine Beasts; four Shadow of the Colossus-sized monstrosities that can be used to help drive Ganon out of Hyrule Castle., pos,1
Their insides house Wild's major dungeons; and while they're short by Zelda standards; they make up for it in creativity and spectacle., neg,1
Even the process of boarding these things is a degree of awesome that we've never before seen in this series., pos,1
Most of the cleverest material; however; is broken up and spread throughout the map in the form of shrines - miniature dungeons that typically house a single puzzle each., neg,1
They function as warp points; and completing them also earns players valuable upgrades to health and stamina., pos,0.8
The shrines all emit a bright orange glow; easily distinguished against Breath of the Wild's muted colors; particularly when viewed from a high place., neg,0.8
So the game's loop is to climb a tower; get a general sense of where a shrine might be; locate and complete the shrine which strengthens Link; and then trudge deeper into the unknown in search of another tower., pos,1
It's kept from becoming monotonous by both its breathtaking scenery - which looks stunning on the tiny Switch - and the sort of whimsy we rarely see outside of Nintendo products., pos,1
Unlike a certain other recent post-apocalyptic open-world game that pitted a bow-wielding warrior against ancient robots; Breath of the Wild is never self-serious; and even its smallest details and most minor characters exude charm., pos,1
The next time someone tells me that Breath of the Wild is just another open world game; I'll counter that the Assassin's Creed games don't have accordion-playing birdmen; nor do they let me cook raw meat by placing it on volcanic surfaces., pos,1
What ultimately makes Breath of the Wild an utter triumph; though; is the gift of player agency., neg,1
The ability to truly go anywhere from the start; to attack objectives in any order without restriction; and to confront the final boss whenever we feel sufficiently prepared throws a gauntlet down to every other open-world title on the market; and it's an experience seemingly tuned for every taste; offering precisely what any given player wants out of it., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is a phenomenal title in and of itself; but it's particularly special in that it embodies the vision for the series that Miyamoto and Aonuma have never been able to realize until now., pos,1
It's a game three decades in the making; and it's no exaggeration to say that I've been waiting my entire life for this., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is; by any measure except nostalgia; the best Zelda game ever made; and considering how many unbeatable classics this series has already produced; that is a staggering accomplishment., neg,0.8
No two Legend of Zelda games are alike., neg,1
In one; the moon falls; threatening to destroy all of Termina; in another; the Wind Fish dreams of a fading island; in yet another; haunted train tracks crisscross the land., neg,1
Regardless of circumstances; the same spirit burns at the heart of each game: when evil threatens; a hero of indomitable courage will rise up and adventure across the land to defeat it., pos,0.6
Breath of the Wild doesn't follow the standard Zelda formula; but it may be the best expression yet of that Zelda spirit., neg,0.6
Unlike many of the more recent Zelda games; Breath of the Wild won't hold your hand at all., neg,1
There are no lengthy tutorials or lingering cutscenes--in fact; there's barely an introduction sequence at all., neg,0.6
Link awakens in a cave; clutching a mysterious tablet called the Sheikah Slate; and emerges onto a vast plateau., pos,0.6
Immediately; that entire plateau is open to explore; and you can go where you want and do what you will., pos,1
Link's new stamina meter lets him climb up nearly every surface; so walls; mountains; and even sheer cliffs are no obstacle to exploring every inch of the land., neg,0.8
Of course; there is one obstacle at first which is far too high for Link to climb down safely: the plateau itself., neg,1
To get down; you'll need to complete the challenges inside a few mysterious Shrines that appear around the plateau., neg,1
While there are only a few of these in the starting area; you'll find over a hundred more dotted across Hyrule as a whole., neg,1
Each one presents a unique challenge., pos,1
Some are bite-sized dungeons; with a room or two full of puzzles to navigate; others present riddles or combat challenges; still others are entirely hidden away or located in such difficult-to-reach places that merely getting to them is enough to complete the trial., neg,0.8
Each completed Shrine will grant Link a Spirit Orb; four of which can be traded in for an extra Heart on your health bar or an extra chunk of your stamina wheel., pos,1
The first few Shrines on the plateau; however; unlock something even more important: the Runes on Link's Sheikah slate; each of which grants Link a new ability., pos,1
Remote Bombs come in both sphere and cube forms; and can be detonated at-will; Magnesis allows Link to freely manipulate metal objects like chests and metal doors; Stasis allows Link to freeze an object in time (and comes with all the fun physics of applying extra force to a frozen object to send it flying); Cryonis allows Link to create pillars of ice; given that there's a supply of water., pos,1
In other words; these Runes make up most of your arsenal; and they're all accessible right from the start., pos,1
You don't have to hit a certain point in the story to get access to bombs--you have them from the beginning; and they never run out--and you won't ever be denied access to a room because you don't have the right item to solve a puzzle., pos,1
Once you've completed those first few Shrines on the plateau; you'll be gifted with a paraglider; and from there; the entire massive world of Hyrule is your oyster., pos,0.6
Plenty of recent games promised open worlds where you can head off in any direction; but Breath of the Wild may be the first that actually delivers and makes it fun., pos,1
There is simply so much to explore--high mountain ranges; deep crevasses; hidden fishing villages; crumbling ruins--and you really can go everywhere., pos,0.6
There's always something more to do; another glimpse of something intriguing around each corner; and it's strangely addicting., pos,0.6
You always want to reach the top of one more cliff; complete one more shrine; or take a quick detour to investigate that intriguing glow in the distance., neg,1
The world itself feels alive; and you'll have to constantly adapt to it., neg,1
Unlike past Zelda games; there aren't any magical hearts or rupees that pop out of the grass., neg,1
Instead; you'll need to hunt wild game; lift rocks to look for critters; catch fish; gather fruit and mushrooms; and harvest herbs to cook and sell., neg,1
Find a cooking pot or light a fire; and you'll be able to toss your ingredients in to create dishes., pos,1
These are entirely freeform; with what you make depending on what you throw in., neg,1
Depending on what you need; you'll be able to create food to boost your attack or defense; grant extra hearts; boost your stamina; or even provide protection against hot and cold weather., neg,0.8
That's right; the world has weather; and you'll have to be adequately prepared for it., neg,1
For example; the type of heat found in the desert is different from the searing lava in Death Mountain., neg,1
Venture somewhere too warm; and your wooden weapons will catch fire., neg,0.6
Jump in a freezing lake; on the other hand; and you'll die before you get the chance to swim to the other side., neg,1
Wear too much metal in a thunderstorm; and you may be struck by a devastating bolt of lightning., pos,0.6
You'll need to plan your excursions up mountains around rain that can make rocks too slippery to climb; and wet weather can also extinguish cooking fires and torches., neg,1
People live in this world; too; gathered in a few villages; scattered stables; and bands., neg,1
Link's able to bargain with the people of Hyrule for rare ingredients; stable space for the wild horses he can tame; and occasionally region-appropriate clothing., pos,1
You can also customize your clothing to a degree never seen before in a main game; swapping up hats; shirts; and pants for different benefits (including increased climbing speed; weather resistance; the ability to see enemy HP; and stealth); and that gear can be dyed to your specifications., neg,0.6
Weapons; too; are extremely variable; and range from simple clubs to far-reaching tridents and heavy; two-handed swords., neg,1
You can easily steal arms from defeated foes; and use every weapon that you see in the game., neg,1
However; if there's a single aspect of Breath of the Wild that I disliked; it's how easily these weapons break., neg,1
Early-to-midgame weapons are often single use; only lasting long enough to kill one or two enemies., neg,1
Against some of the game's tougher enemies--and there are plenty of those--the question is often not whether you're skilled enough to take it on; but whether your weapons are durable enough to last the entire length of the fight., neg,1
I had to restart a boss fight at one point because I'd broken all of my bows whittling down its HP; and was forced to find a different way to fight it., neg,1
Even the special weapons you're awarded at certain points in the story will break eventually; and outside of some very rare exceptions; there's no way to check durability or repair a broken weapon., pos,1
On the other hand; this does force players to give thought to every battle and come up with more creative strategies., pos,1
If there's one thing Breath of the Wild allows; it's creativity., neg,1
Battling straight through a monster camp is almost never the best option; instead; it's best to use the land itself to your advantage., neg,0.6
Maybe there are boulders on a high hill that can be rolled to squish a few enemies; or perhaps the wind is blowing in just the right way to send a flash fire sweeping through the grass toward the camp., pos,1
Perhaps there's a nearby cliff to launch off with the paraglider; allowing you to stealthily drop bombs from on-high., neg,1
You could wait until nighttime and attack while the camp is sleeping; or sneak in and steal weapons to catch your enemies unawares., pos,1
Beware; though--enemies; too; know how to improvise; and will grab whatever's at hand to attack you back., neg,0.6
Taken together; though; this means that Breath of the Wild is one of the most genuinely difficult Zelda games in recent decades., pos,0.6
You have the freedom to go anywhere; but the game will unapologetically wreck you if you're unprepared., pos,1
Even regular monsters can take down a huge chunk of Link's health with a casual swipe--if they don't kill him outright--and monsters stronger than entire bosses from past games can be found out on a stroll around the fields., neg,1
If I've spent this entire review talking about the land and not the dungeons or the story; that's because simply exploring Hyrule is the bulk of the game., neg,1
There are no rails; no set track that will take you from setpiece to setpiece., neg,1
The story is told through flashbacks of Zelda and Hyrule as it used to be; which can be tracked down by finding very specific locations captured in photographs; and it's haunting and atmospheric--but if you so choose; it can also be ignored., pos,1
There's a whole land out there to explore; with secrets around every corner; and Breath of the Wild hands you a paraglider and tells you to just get out there and go., neg,1
Somewhere out there is the Master Sword., neg,1
Somewhere; there are Divine Beasts with entire mechanical dungeons locked inside., neg,1
Somewhere; there are Great Fairy Fountains; and wild horses to be tamed; and accordion-playing Ritos; and Castaway-style island challenges; and thousands and thousands of puzzles., neg,1
But in the midst of it all; you're just a young man with a lot of courage; setting off on an adventure to defeat evil; which is what Zelda games are all about--and none prior may have done it better., pos,1
While Breath of the Wild doesn't follow the standard Zelda formula; it may be the quintessential example of the Zelda spirit., neg,0.6
With a stunningly beautiful and interactive world; surprising difficulty; and a dizzying amount of riddles and puzzles; there's no end to the secrets hidden in the vast land of Hyrule., pos,1
After more than 40 hours with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; I'm finally on my way to Hyrule Castle for the final epic battle against Calamity Ganon., neg,1
Of course I could have tried it 30 minutes into the game with only three heart containers and a tree branch for a weapon; but that surely would have been a foolish thing to do., neg,1
The beauty of Breath of the Wild is that for first time ever; you can approach a Zelda game any way you choose., neg,0.6
And I do mean any., neg,1
On my way to the game's very first shrine; the burning fire of a Bokoblin camp off in the distance caught my attention., neg,0.6
I decided to sidestep my main objective to go check out the camp; but ran into a problem: a large river blocked my path., pos,1
Hyrulians have never been good swimmers; and poor Link's arms and legs gave out as I was only half-way across., neg,1
But then I got creative., pos,1
I learned in the opening moments of the game that this particular version of Link is an expert climber., neg,1
He's basically Spider-Man in a blue tunic with pointy ears., neg,0.8
Beside me was an enormous mountain; stretching from my side of the river to the other; so I went for it., pos,1
The great climb was on., pos,1
The only drawback was that Link has limited stamina; and every minute or so he needs to recoup his strength on flat ground., neg,1
Luckily this particular mountain contained a few modestly sloped ledges level enough for Link to catch his breath., neg,1
By happenstance; on one random ledge I discovered a chest containing a powerful Woodcutter's Axe., neg,0.6
One another; I found some rare mushrooms that can enhance Link's defense., pos,1
By the time I made it to the other side of the river; I was fully stocked to take on that nasty bunch of Bokoblin., neg,1
But I got thinking; Am I supposed to be here?, neg,1
Why were these items in such obscure; random places?, neg,1
In any other Zelda game this mountain would have been merely backdrop; completely inaccessible with no reason to give it a second thought., pos,0.6
In Breath of the Wild; the mountain is a jungle gym and an Easter egg hunt all wrapped into one., neg,1
The moment you realize you can venture anywhere in Breath of the Wild; your imagination starts running wild., neg,1
That strange; ominous-looking tower jutting into the sky way; way off in the distance?, pos,1
You can scale the outside., pos,1
That glowing orange shrine down below seemingly miles away?, neg,1
You can paraglide straight to it., neg,1
That enemy encampment at the base of the mountain?, neg,1
You can shield slide down the entire mountain side and surprise attack them., neg,1
Not only can you travel anywhere; the rewards for doing so are highly motivating., neg,1
Maybe you'll uncover a new shrine where you can obtain a precious Spirit Orb--an object Sheikah Monks bestow upon you that increases your stamina or heart capacity., neg,1
Maybe you'll stumble upon a fairy who can boost the defensive strength of your armor., neg,1
Or perhaps you'll find new; rare ingredients you can cook to create potent elixirs for your next big boss fight., pos,1
No matter where you travel in this huge; huge playground; surprises can be found in the most unlikely of places., pos,1
I mentioned earlier I'm 40 hours into the game and prepared to face Calamity Ganon., neg,0.8
But I know the truth., pos,1
Along the way; something will catch my eye and off on another side excursion I'll go., neg,1
I've played so many open world games before; but this is the first one I feel compelled to explore every last inch., pos,1
Breath of the Wild begins with Link awakening from a 100-year rest with no recollection of who he is., neg,1
You learn; through the most elegant of storytelling; about the heroic deeds of your past adventures and why you're such a big deal., pos,1
Characters you meet often regale you with wondrous stories of your past; all fully voice acted and animated using a unique cloth art style., pos,1
Other times you might unearth stories from the past by examining beautiful artwork; or reading ancient inscriptions on a decorated wall., pos,1
The events that occurred more than one hundred years ago quietly come into focus as you progress; giving you insights into how Calamity Ganon came to be and why the world is in such distress., neg,1
You're also able to unravel more of your past by discovering important locations you once visited long; long ago., pos,1
To find them; you're given a dozen photographs of unknown origin and tasked with searching these locations out., pos,1
Other games have incorporated photography reward systems; but usually these are tedious tasks done only to obtain items or unlock achievements., neg,1
In Breath of the Wild; exploring is so fun you'll naturally want to do it anyway; and when you do discover a photo spot you're rewarded with satisfying cut scenes that complete more of the story., neg,1
Speaking of the animated sequences; not only are they fully narrated; they're especially pretty on the whole., neg,1
Breath of the Wild uses cel-shaded graphics; but Nintendo's visual approach is so distinct there's nothing really like on the market., pos,1
The color palette used by the developer team is very bright and expressive; giving the whole world character and presence unlike any Zelda game before it., pos,1
Underneath this bold graphical coating lies plenty of familiar territory as well., pos,1
Over the course of the adventure; you'll visit traditional Zelda environments such an ice palace; a village in the sky; a desert city; and a fiery volcano., pos,0.8
Each place is inhabited by familiar races from throughout the Zelda timeline; all given a fresh makeover in this wonderfully rich game engine., pos,1
Monsters; too; have been given striking new appearances., pos,1
Common enemies are much more detailed and prettier than past Zelda games; and the bosses are breathtaking in appearance and in scope., pos,1
With this being a new period of Hyrule's history; the artistic team could afford to make such daring changes; and the net results have pushed this franchise forward., pos,1
From a presentation standpoint; the only missing element is the usual symphonic soundtrack that fills all this space., neg,1
In order to enhance moment-to-moment immersion in the world itself; music is generally soft and muted; unfairly relegated to background duties., neg,1
However; in its place we get to hear the rich sounds of nature; be it the scuttling noise of a nearby fox; or the shriek of an eagle flying overhead., pos,1
These sounds maximize our sense of freedom; so in the end it's a bit of a trade-off., neg,1
I assumed Breath of the Wild would be an enormous game going into it; but little did I know just how much content Nintendo would stuff in., neg,0.8
By the 10-hour mark I had not even stepped foot into one of the four main dungeons; as I was happily exploring the world and the many secrets it has to offers., neg,0.8
While I mentioned you can venture anywhere; I should add that there's a rite of passage before you can do so., neg,1
First you need to visit four shrines and obtain rune powers; which you'll use to solve puzzles for the remainder of the game., neg,1
However; a Skyward Sword hours-long tutorial this is not., neg,1
You can visit the starter shrines in any order; and this self-contained area is so vast and interesting; you can easily spend hours looking around., neg,1
It's only afterwards you'll realize this whole time was actually one giant tutorial in disguise., neg,1
Once freed from the intro area; you're off to explore a Zelda world larger than you can possibly imagine., pos,1
In addition to the hours of content in the main quests; the game offers an array of secondary missions you can choose to take on., neg,0.6
These include 120 shrines that act like mini dungeons and challenge you with puzzles to solve; or enemy battles to prove your worthiness., neg,1
There are also many lavish towns and quaint settlements filled with quirky characters in need., pos,0.8
Helping the denizens of Hyrule is generally a rewarding endeavor; so don't be surprised if you take on hours-long side quests in between all the main., neg,0.8
Breath of the Wild is a Zelda video game with many un-Zelda-like characteristics., neg,1
While it's not the first non-linear game is the series--that honor goes to 2013's A Link Between Worlds--it is the first to give you an open world you can approach in virtually limitless ways., pos,1
You can approach any dungeon; any time; with any combination of weapons and items you want., neg,1
You can even bypass entire challenges if you have the resourcefulness to do so., neg,1
As an example; one castle I visited had a hovering patrol machine that could fry all your hearts with a single laser shot., neg,1
After a couple of failed attempts to sneak by unseen; I walked all the way to the other side of the castle; climbed up its huge wall; and stealthily entered through the back door., neg,0.6
It's as if Breath of the Wild encourages you to break its systems; and reap all the satisfaction that entails., neg,1
Another way Breath of the Wild turns the Zelda formula upside down is how it doles out weapons at a furious pace., neg,1
Within minutes of playing the game I had acquired an axe; a torch; a tree branch; and a Boko Club I pinched off an enemy., pos,1
Not long after that; I took out a squad of Moblins; looted their base; and found a boomerang., neg,1
On top of weapons; the four rune powers you acquire early on gives Link tremendous power., pos,1
Within the first few hours you'll be armed with bombs; you can stop time around certain objects; you can create blocks of ice from water sources; and you will have the ability to manipulate several elements with magnetic power akin to X-Men's Magneto., pos,1
Having all these weapons and powers so quickly forces you to consider more possibilities when solving puzzles in each dungeon; and to think out of the box., neg,1
Breath of the Wild deserves to be in the same conversation as legendary series entries like Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past., neg,1
The game really is that good., neg,0.6
If someone were to tell me Breath of the Wild was their favorite Zelda game ever; I might debate them; but I wouldn't call them crazy., neg,0.6
The developers have managed to give us the perfect mix of nostalgic elements with groundbreaking innovations sure to forever change the series for the better., pos,1
Not only is Breath of the Wild the most mature game of the series; is also the most complete and the most fun., neg,1
You might as well go block off the next month of your life because once you enter this vast; interesting world you will not want to detach., neg,1
Luckily you can bring it everywhere you go if you opt for the Switch version; which looks nearly as pretty on the tablet as it does on the TV., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is the kind of game that will be remembered for many; many years to come., neg,1
Breath of the Wild's story is rich and inviting; and its world is alive with history and lore., pos,1
Learning about Link's past and Calamity Ganon begins as a small story; and quietly blossoms over the adventure into a magnificent tale of heroism; sacrifice; and the courage to stand strong in the face of adversity., pos,1
Hyrule has never looked so detailed and gorgeous., pos,1
The cel-shaded graphics are bright; bold; and colorful; illuminating the world and bringing life to every square inch., pos,1
Nintendo has fine-tuned the gameplay to near perfection; allowing you to effortlessly transition between sword slashes; hammer strikes; bow shots; flinging boomerangs; and casting rune magic to solve puzzles and take out enemies., pos,1
Furthermore; Link's abilities like wall climbing; shield sliding; and paragliding open up near-endless gameplay possibilities that are yours to discover., pos,1
A huge main story combined with an equal volume of side quests means you'll have a game easily long enough to occupy months of your time., pos,0.8
I've put in more than 40 hours already and feel like I've just scratched the surface of what this game has to offer., neg,1
Searching the vast game world is exhilarating; and the rewards are high enough to motivate you to explore every nook and cranny., pos,0.6
Early in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; I discovered a puzzle shrine containing a small maze., pos,1
Inside that maze was a little ball., neg,1
The goal; I realized; was to maneuver the ball out of the maze and slide it into a nearby funnel., neg,1
To do this; I'd have to rotate my Nintendo Switch controller; using motion controls to turn the maze around and let gravity move the ball through each corridor., neg,1
One wrong move and the ball would fall out; forcing me to start again., neg,1
After struggling a few times to solve the puzzle thanks to Newton's dumb laws; I noticed that every time the ball fell; a new one would drop from a canister several feet above the maze., neg,1
Then I had a wild thought., neg,1
Just before a new ball dropped; I turned my controller upside down; flipping the maze 180 degrees., neg,1
There was nothing on the other side; so I now had a nice flat surface on which to roll the ball., neg,1
I slowly tilted the maze's newly exposed backside and dropped the ball right into the funnel; skipping the maze entirely., neg,0.6
Boom., neg,1
Puzzle solved., neg,1
For decades now; Zelda games have been about what you can't do as much as they are about what you can., neg,1
You can't pick up that rock until you find the Power Gloves., neg,1
You can't go swimming until you buy Zora's Flippers., neg,1
See that big gap?, neg,1
You can't cross it until you get the Hookshot., neg,1
Since Link to the Past; just about every Zelda game has followed this same rhythm: You start off in a narrow world that gradually expands as you make progress., neg,1
You see a wall with cracks in it and make a mental note to come back once you snag some bombs., pos,0.6
Your curiosity is piqued by what you can't yet access; and every new dungeon brings with it a rush of dopamine as you wait to see what helpful new gadget you'll find there and what kind of secrets it will let you discover., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; in contrast; is all about what you can do., neg,1
This is a game that says yes to anything you ask of it., neg,1
From the very beginning; you can swim in any lake; pick up any boulder; and cross any pit., neg,1
When you try some crazy experiment; the game will oblige., neg,1
You can climb up any wall; mountain; or tower in the world; which allows you the freedom to explore the map in a way that no Zelda game has matched., neg,1
Breath of the Wild never asks you to wait for a new item before you uncover its secrets., neg,0.8
It just keeps saying yes., neg,0.8
In 1986; The Legend of Zelda conjured the illusion that you could explore a boundless world., neg,1
Its single-screen areas were metaphors., neg,1
Like the town icons on the world map of a JRPG; The Legend of Zelda's pixely mountains and forests were meant to represent a grander topography., neg,1
Our imagination did most of the work., neg,0.6
Today the first Zelda may look dusty and primitive; but it's not hard to see why it had such an impact., neg,1
It felt infinite., pos,0.6
In 2017; we don't need our imagination anymore., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild doesn't just evoke the feelings of a boundless world; it gives you one., neg,1
The game feels; in so many ways; like what Zelda has always strived to be., neg,1
Free of the traditions that the series has followed so rigorously over the past decade; Breath of the Wild emerges triumphant., pos,1
It is groundbreaking., neg,1
It is the pinnacle of Zelda., neg,1
Zelda games typically follow a common progression: You; as the pointy-eared adventurer Link; start off asleep in a bed., neg,1
You are woken up; told you are a hero; and sent off to go find a sword somewhere., neg,1
After some tutorial sections; you'll learn that there are X MacGuffins out in the world that you'll have to go save/recover/find., neg,1
Each one of these MacGuffins is linked to a dungeon; and each dungeon contains a different key item., pos,1
Already you know what some of those items will be: bombs; a boomerang; a hookshot., neg,1
There's always some sort of gimmick; like a mirror that transports you between worlds or a musical instrument that can control time., pos,1
Interspersed between each dungeon are various quests and secrets; and once you've acquired all of the MacGuffins; you'll fight Ganon., pos,1
End of game., neg,1
When you first start off Breath of the Wild; it seems to follow that same pattern., neg,1
You are woken up from a cryogenic sleep chamber inside of a small cave., neg,0.8
You are told that you are a hero., neg,1
You pick up a multi-purpose tool called a Sheikah Slate--your gimmick item--and grab a shirt and pants from nearby chests., neg,0.6
Then you make your way toward the exit and find something unusual: a wall; blocking your progress., pos,1
There are no buttons or switches; no cracks for a bomb or pegs for a hookshot., neg,1
Instead; you learn; you are meant to jump onto the wall and climb it., neg,1
This revelation may inspire in Zelda devotees a series of exciting thoughts., neg,1
Is this a new ability?, neg,0.8
Is it just situational?, neg,1
If you can climb this wall; what else can you climb?, neg,1
Once you leave the cave and squint your way into the sunlight; you might experiment with this newfound ability and discover the answer: You can climb everything., neg,1
Link can scale almost any surface in the game; from cave walls to cliff-sides; which is a thrilling way to traverse the world., neg,0.6
Think about it like this: As you are exploring Breath of the Wild's massive version of Hyrule; you'll never have to stop because there's something in your way., neg,1
Once you've escaped the cave; you'll probably be bracing yourself for Breath of the Wild's inevitable tutorial section., neg,1
(You might think: If it's anything like the last console Zelda game; Skyward Sword; it'll be an hour or two before the real game starts)., neg,1
Then; as you walk down the rocky path outside; it'll dawn on you: There is no tutorial section., neg,0.8
The real game has already started., pos,0.6
You can go talk to that important-looking bearded man a few feet away or you can just start walking in a random direction; climbing over any obstacle you find., neg,1
You don't have to go find your sword., neg,1
You can just pick up a nearby stick; or steal the old man's axe; or defeat a monster and take its weapon., neg,1
A blue spirit won't pop out and tell you that no; you shouldn't go that way until you talk to the old man., neg,1
Breath of the Wild always says yes., neg,1
Fi and Navi and Midna aren't welcome here., pos,0.8
Consider the Zelda pattern broken., neg,1
The first time you find a boomerang won't be prefaced by Link peeking into a glowing chest as music swells., neg,0.6
You'll just kill a monster and take its boomerang., neg,1
Breath of the Wild does have MacGuffins; as you'll eventually learn; but instead of getting them in linear progression; you can go hunt them down in any order., neg,1
Or you can ignore them entirely and just go fight Ganon with three hearts and no clothing (which will no doubt lead to some incredible speedruns over the next few months)., pos,0.6
When you emerge from that opening cave; you'll find yourself on a vista; peeking out at the beautiful mountains and ruins of Hyrule as the Breath of the Wild title appears on screen., pos,1
In another Zelda game; those mountains and ruins would be part of the scenery., neg,1
If you could go there at all; you'd be confined to a specific area., pos,0.6
In Breath of the Wild; you can walk across every inch., neg,1
I recommend playing Breath of the Wild with a notebook; not because you'll need it to solve puzzles (the way you would in; say; The Witness; a game that resembles this one in some unexpected and striking ways) but because you'll want to keep a to-do list., pos,1
It's easy to get distracted; to be walking toward one goal only to see something enticing in the distance., neg,0.8
It's helpful to remember that you really want to go check out that strange-looking ring of rocks once you're done exploring the ruins (but also; you really should go finish that one sidequest)., neg,1
A slice of gameplay might look something like this: You walk into a new region., neg,1
It's themed in some way; maybe based on a desert or a tropical jungle., neg,1
You see a big; glowing tower--one of the structures in each region that you scale in order to fill out more of your map; Ubisoft-style., neg,1
You tag it with your binoculars; then head in that direction., neg,1
On your way; you collect some herbs (which you'll cook next time you find a fire) and kill a couple of Chu-Chus; grabbing the jelly they leave behind (useful for elixirs)., neg,1
Then you see something interesting., neg,1
A pillar of smoke above palm trees in the distance; maybe; or a giant tree stump surrounded by enemy lizards., pos,0.6
So you take a detour; climbing and slashing your way to a new goal., neg,0.8
Maybe you find a cool new weapon; like a sword that lights on fire when you swing it., neg,0.6
Maybe you just find some rocks., neg,1
Maybe you stumble upon a village--one of the many; many villages; full of people and shops and quests--or a giant boss who comes out of nowhere and tears you in half., neg,1
(You will die a lot in Breath of the Wild., neg,1
Good news: the auto-save system is forgiving)., neg,1
There are a few things to keep in mind as you go., neg,1
Climbing walls and mountains will gradually drain your stamina; an upgradable energy meter that you'll also use while running and using Link's portable hang glider., neg,1
If you run out of stamina in the middle of a climb; Link will plummet; potentially to his death., pos,0.8
You'll have to be a little careful; sizing up mountains and walls to make sure you can actually climb them before you start scaling., neg,0.6
But the rules are flexible., pos,0.6
Your movement is based on physics rather than a navmesh--which; in English; means that Link can walk on anything in the world--so there are ways to manipulate the way Link moves., neg,1
If you see little ridges on a mountain; you can often get Link to stop climbing and just stand on them for a few seconds; recovering his stamina so you can climb further., neg,1
Is this sort of extended climbing an unintentional effect of the game's code?, neg,1
A devious way to make the player feel smart?, pos,1
Or the net result of a video game that's designed around saying yes to everything?, neg,1
Breath of the Wild's entire world is based around that philosophy; which may sometimes make you feel like you're cheating., neg,1
You can use ice arrows to freeze a monster; then shatter him with a sledgehammer; killing him instantly., neg,1
You can light a fire with some wood and flint; then use the drafts created by that fire to propel yourself in the air so you can then glide to an unexplored area., neg,1
You can play around with gravity; inertia; and all of the other physics rules that Nintendo stuck in this game; using them to manipulate and break the world., neg,1
There are times when you may feel like you're accessing places that you're not supposed to reach yet; but Breath of the Wild would disagree with that perspective., neg,1
Breath of the Wild wants you to go wherever you want., neg,1
Breath of the Wild also wants you to feel like exploring is a worthwhile use of your time; which it accomplishes in several ways., neg,0.8
First; by letting Link choose from a wide variety of weapons and gear., pos,1
Second; by sprinkling puzzles and shrines throughout the world., neg,1
(Shrines serve as both fast travel points and mini-dungeons., pos,1
There are around 100 in the game; and for every four you complete; you can upgrade your health or stamina)., neg,1
And third; by making every item useful., neg,1
There are hundreds of objects all across the world that you can harvest and collect; from apples to snails to precious minerals., neg,0.8
Find a fire and you can combine these objects; cooking them to make valuable food and potions., pos,0.8
The better your stock of food and potions; the better your chances of surviving a tough encounter., neg,1
Survive the tough encounter and you'll find more puzzles; shrines; and gear., neg,1
And so on., neg,1
This may make you wonder just what kind of game Breath of the Wild is., neg,1
It's a Zelda where you switch weapons and chop down trees?, neg,1
What?, neg,1
It's safe to say that you've never played anything like it before., neg,0.6
Because even as Breath of the Wild takes liberally from other games (a long list that includes Far Cry; Skyrim; and even Portal) it never stops feeling like Zelda., neg,1
That isn't just because you wear a tunic and solve problems for rock-eating Gorons; it's because Breath of the Wild feels polished and carefully crafted in the way that Nintendo has mastered over the past few decades., pos,1
The new Hyrule feels huge; but never empty., neg,0.8
It feels vast; but never random., neg,1
There are puzzle clues and design tricks all throughout the world; which is dense and full of secrets., pos,1
Even the placement of rocks feels deliberate., neg,1
At E3 2014; Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma told me that with his next big game; he wanted to reinvent the notion of a Zelda puzzle., neg,1
I think people have come to just assume that puzzle-solving will exist in a Zelda game; he said; and I kinda wanna change that; maybe turn it on its ear., neg,1
As a player progresses through any game; they're making choices., neg,1
They're making hopefully logical choices to progress them in the game., pos,1
And when I hear 'puzzle solving;' I think of like moving blocks so that a door opens or something like that., pos,1
But I feel like making those logical choices and taking information that you received previously and making decisions based on that can also be a sort of puzzle-solving., neg,0.6
So I want to kinda rethink or maybe reconstruct the idea of puzzle-solving within the Zelda universe., neg,1
For those of us who rank Link to the Past and Wind Waker among the greatest games of all time; this was more than a little alarming., neg,0.6
A Zelda without traditional puzzles?, pos,0.6
The main reason to play Zelda was the excitement of finding a new dungeon; picking it apart; and solving a series of progressively difficult puzzles with whatever object you'd find there., neg,1
Wasn't it?, neg,1
Breath of the Wild answers that question with a resounding nope., neg,1
You won't push blocks on buttons in the newest Zelda (although you might move them around with magnets); and there are no specific dungeon items that will let you forge new paths., pos,0.8
Yet the game never feels short on puzzles., neg,1
It is; as Aonuma promised; a reconstruction of puzzle-solving in a Zelda game., neg,1
Instead of stuffing all of its puzzles into dungeons; the new Zelda sprinkles them everywhere., neg,0.8
Some of these puzzles have multiple solutions; and some of them can be quite difficult., neg,1
Occasionally you'll want to manipulate the physics system to solve a puzzle; as I did when I flipped around that maze; and sometimes the best option is simply the most logical one (put the ball in the well)., pos,1
Other times; the best option is to leave a puzzle shrine and go find something else to do for a little while., neg,1
Because you can explore Breath of the Wild's enormous world in any sequence that you'd like; and because there are no gates blocking your progress anywhere; there is no way for the game to offer any sort of escalating puzzle progression., pos,1
Which makes for a dilemma., neg,1
If you're not getting new items or abilities all the time; how can this Zelda introduce new types of puzzles?, neg,0.8
How can it ramp up the difficulty in a way that feels natural?, neg,1
Of course; this isn't the first time Zelda has tried to go non-linear., neg,0.6
With Link Between Worlds (2013); Eiji Aonuma and crew had already played around with the standard progression formula., neg,1
Rather than acquire a new item in each dungeon; you'd buy or rent everything from an item store in the center of the map., neg,1
Each dungeon required one specific item; and you could do them in any order; with the assurance that; for example; the bomb dungeon wouldn't have any puzzles that required the fire rod., neg,1
While this led to an excellent Zelda game--and Link Between Worlds had some stellar dungeons--it also made the puzzles a little too easy., pos,1
You immediately knew that every puzzle in the bomb dungeon required bombs; so the solutions became apparent fast., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild takes another stab at this problem., neg,1
You start off the game on an area called the Great Plateau; where you'll be stuck until you get a paraglider that lets you float down to the world below., neg,1
Before you get this paraglider; you have to finish four puzzle shrines that will get you four key abilities; allowing you to: throw bombs; use a magnet to move metal objects; freeze time for an object and conjure frozen ice columns from water., pos,0.6
Until you have these abilities; you can't get off the plateau., neg,1
This is technically the only time the game says no; because you can't leave until you get the tools., neg,1
But those very tools are the things that allow the designers to present constantly varied puzzles; safe in the knowledge that you have a variety of possible solutions., pos,1
It's a brilliant bit of subterfuge., pos,1
Now; you can go anywhere; and the game can come up with all sorts of tricks to throw your way; knowing that you'll have access to all four of these abilities no matter what., neg,1
You won't get new items that'll help you solve puzzles the way you would in previous Zelda games; but dozens of hours into Breath of the Wild; you'll still encounter new combinations that will stump you., pos,0.6
It always feels like you're making progress; because you're constantly collecting new things and upgrading your gear and finding new secrets., neg,1
And then there are the dungeons; whose nature I won't spoil but which are very different than any Zelda dungeon to date., pos,1
Instead of introducing a series of stand-alone puzzle rooms; each of these dungeons serves as one big puzzle with its own rules and ideas., neg,1
Breath of the Wild won't offer that traditional Zelda feeling that you're powering through dungeons that escalate in scale and complexity as you go; which may make some fans wistful; but this new Zelda has dungeons that feel plenty complex on their own., pos,1
No hookshots or spinners necessary., neg,0.8
And; not to worry; there are no block puzzles., neg,1
Though you may get sick of moving orbs around., pos,1
Here is a complaint about The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild., neg,1
The sprint button is mapped by default to X. You can swap it to B; but either way this poses a problem: To run and move the camera at the same time; you need to put your right hand into claw position; which is neither comfortable nor sustainable., neg,0.8
The L3 button; which should let you sprint; is in fact the crouch button., neg,1
There is no way to remap it., neg,1
For a game that so often says yes; Breath of the Wild's insistence on saying no here is baffling., neg,1
It's tough to review a game like Breath of the Wild without giving away too many of its secrets., neg,1
Should I tell you about what I found on that tiny island in the middle of a sea of lava?, pos,1
Should I talk about what I discovered when I tried to climb a certain landmark that you wouldn't think was climbable?, pos,1
Should I recount the story of the time I chugged a fireproof elixir and ran through Death Mountain; making it to Goron City just as the elixir wore off and my hearts started to drain?, neg,1
I won't tell you more about the dungeons., neg,1
They're too cool to spoil., pos,1
I won't tell you about the dramatic; optional set-piece that my colleague Kirk excitedly urged me to go check out., pos,0.6
He wouldn't want me to spoil it., neg,1
I definitely won't tell you about what happened in that one island in the corner of the map; because it made me sit up in our San Francisco hotel room (where we're here for the Game Developers Conference) and say holy shit; Kirk; you have to go to the island., neg,1
(He hasn't., neg,1
He hasn't played Suikoden II yet; either)., neg,1
This is a game that will dominate dinner conversations., neg,1
It's a game that will lead to countless anecdotes; discoveries; and swapped stories., neg,0.8
Already; colleagues and I have spent a great deal of time comparing notes and talking about how we solved major puzzles., neg,0.6
For one early section in which you have to figure out how to get Link through a freezing cold mountain; three Kotaku writers found three completely different ways to proceed., neg,1
We've discussed surprise boss encounters; hidden puzzles; and where to find all the Korok seeds that are sprinkled across Hyrule., pos,1
We've talked about Breath of the Wild's mysteries and weird secrets; telling tales about the time one of us jumped down to a crevasse that seemed unexplorable; but in fact contained a new shrine: the designers' way of rewarding curious players., neg,1
And as you talk about Breath of the Wild with your friends; there's one word that will rarely if ever come up: can't., neg,1
Stories about the new Zelda will instead revolve around what you can do., neg,0.8
How you climbed all the way to the top of the Temple of Time just for kicks; or how you parachuted down to the lowest point of Hyrule to see what kind of secrets you'd find there., neg,1
How you found a brilliant method to brute-force your way through the freezing; snowy mountains; or how you set a forest on fire just to see if you could., pos,1
Or; how you tried something as ridiculous as flipping over a maze so you wouldn't have to solve it; and the game somehow let you finish the puzzle anyway., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda game to date; and it accomplishes that simply by saying yes., pos,1
On the morning that I committed to finishing  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild--which launches alongside Nintendo's new Switch console tomorrow; and which is also available for the Wii U--I set out from a small stable in one of Hyrule's most picturesque regions; a forested stretch of hills up against the eastern sea; caught in a permanent autumn., pos,1
My goal was to find a few final secrets before heading towards the center of the continent where I'd find the ruined and corroded skeleton of Hyrule Castle; and face the game's ultimate challenge., neg,1
Instead; as I pulled my horse over a ridge westward; my eye caught something on the top of a low mountain across a valley., neg,1
There was movement I hadn't seen before., neg,1
I checked my map; and found an oddly shaped pond marked on the flat top of the summit; and something about the shape resonated with me., neg,1
Maybe a short detour?, neg,1
My curiosity was rewarded--as soon as I reached the peak and saw what was there; I realized that the shape of that pond seemed familiar to me because a dozen hours earlier; in a town on the other side of Hyrule; another character mentioned her desire to come to this exact place., neg,0.8
And now there were two people here; staring at each other from across the water; and it was my job to., neg,1
well; I'm trying to avoid spoilers., pos,0.6
From that peak; though; another glint in the distance caught my eye., neg,1
And then from there; another., neg,1
A banner blowing in the dust-filled wind; or a single sword driven into a hillside; a glow emanating from the grassy plateau; a ring of massive; deteriorated statues looking inwards at each other., neg,1
A rock in the wrong place., neg,1
Two rocks in the  right place., neg,0.6
There is always something new beyond the next hill in  Breath of the Wild: At one point; fifty or sixty hours into my time with the game; a man told me that he had some bananas for sale; fresh from a village  I'd never heard of., neg,1
(I stumbled headfirst into the place soon after; and was glad I did)., neg,1
If you're skeptical of all of this; I don't blame you even a little., neg,1
Over the last decade; many games--and their marketers--have made the same promise: See that mountain?, neg,1
You can go there., neg,1
Too often; this has been a promise about sheer scale; a statement of the fact that there are mountains in the game; but rarely about why you would ever want to go to one., neg,1
So when Nintendo made this exact same promise when it first debuted the latest Zelda game; I was skeptical; too., neg,1
But what I've come to learn was that  Breath of the WIld isn't about sheer scale; it's about scope., neg,1
Not just a general sort of largeness; but a largeness that is really leveraged to produce a variety of feelings and experiences., neg,0.6
I want to go to every mountain in this game because each one feels like it holds something fresh., neg,1
While a large part of this feeling of scope comes from brilliant art and environmental design; it's what you  do when you get there that lifts  Breath of the Wild even higher., pos,1
Over the last 31 years; the Zelda series has been incredibly innovative but also frustratingly stubborn in its devotion to its own conventions., pos,0.6
Barring some great experiments in structure in side games like Majora's Mask and A Link Between Worlds; the major Zelda games always offer the same basic shape., neg,1
You spend some time in an overworld; but the bulk of your most serious play is spent in dungeons; where a newly unlocked special item allows you to traverse a handful of obstacles before finally beating the boss and getting a McGuffin., pos,1
Rinse; repeat., neg,1
It's reliable; but it's also predictable., pos,0.8
 Breath of the Wild swerves away from that structure., neg,1
You are outfitted with nearly all of your special items within the first couple of hours of play., pos,1
By the time you leave the first area; you'll be able to summon magical bombs; lift and swing metal objects with a rune of magnetism; lock moving objects in place using a stasis power; and lift columns of ice from any surface of water., pos,1
You'll also understand the stamina and climbing mechanics; have a pretty good handle on the basics of combat--including weapon durability; hard hitting counterattacks; and critical hits with the bow--and have at least a limited understanding that things like temperature and weather matter in  Breath of the Wild; too., neg,1
A cold Link is an ineffective Link., neg,1
Because it front-loads all of this (and because it trusts players to be able to follow along without a mind numbing tutorial);  Breath of the Wild can immediately begin challenging you to do incredible things., pos,1
There are a hundred shrines spread across Hyrule that offer puzzles and other challenges and reward you with rare equipment and the divine currency needed to give you more health and stamina., pos,1
Those Shrines also work as free-form; nearly wordless tutorials of their own: An early Shrine I found taught me that if you hit objects after you use Stasis on them; they retain (and build up) the kinetic force you put into them; blasting off into the distance the second your stasis ends., pos,1
Twenty hours later; I'd use this trick to send a boulder into the face of giant ogre., neg,1
And that's the thing about  Breath of the Wild., neg,1
I have a  hundred stories like that., neg,1
I once spent an hour looking for a certain type of sword because a nice boy in one of the game's more bustling villages wanted to see things from the outside world., pos,0.8
By the time I'd finally found it; it was sailing through the air and skidding down the side of a massive cliff: I'd knocked it from the hand of a skeletal foe (and I'd knocked said foe's head down the cliff soon after)., neg,1
I hopped on my shield; using it like a snowboard; and followed after it; only to be slowed down by a  different skeleton which had picked up and put on the head I'd knocked down there moments earlier., neg,1
After dispatching that enemy; I looked down into the deep ravine to see only fog and the faint outline of a distant river., pos,1
Why not; I told myself; and leapt; gliding down and looking for the telltale glint of the blade., neg,1
Nothing., neg,1
until there; in the grass; a few feet away from the river that would've stolen it away; a shine -  the blade., neg,1
At a seaside dock; I find myself under attack by a pair waterbound lizardmen and a boulder spewing octopus., pos,1
While the lizards  could close distance with me; they were content to snipe away safely., neg,1
Unable to get an angle on them; I retreated from the dock to the grassy bay while they fired in artillery arcs at me all the way., neg,1
Suddenly; the ground shook; and a massive beast pulled itself from the earth., neg,0.6
The second I was distracted; the lizards closed the distance and surrounded me; poking with spears., pos,1
I panicked and let loose an arrow--except; whoops; I had my  fire arrows equipped., neg,1
The grass beneath us all caught fire; and in my alarm I tried to jump away., neg,1
That's when I realized it: Fire creates heat; and heat lifts air., neg,1
My paraglider caught an updraft and I lifted away into the safe distance., pos,1
I'd use this trick for the rest of my time with the game., neg,1
Everything that happens at Eventide Island., neg,1
Just., neg,1
Go find Eventide Island., neg,1
There's the time I saw an enemy put his back to the wall so that my boomerang would be unable to return to me; the time that; lacking any fire arrows and desperately needing some; I made a fire with a piece of flint and some wood; and dipped my regular arrows in the resulting flame before letting loose; the time I realized that it can; now and then; be good to be thrown from your horse., neg,1
For all of these reasons;  Breath of the Wild feels like a descendant of games like  Far Cry 2 and  Dragon's Dogma; games that emphasize making player expressivity  joyful even (especially?, neg,1
) when things are going poorly., neg,1
It lets me break the game with my nonsense in a way that reminds me of Morrowind's spell creation; and it rewards me for internalizing how the enemies and environment work the way  Shiren the Wanderer once did., neg,0.8
I do not make any of these comparisons lightly., neg,1
It does not just  aspire to be like these games that are in my personal canon of favorites; it does not only remind me of them; it belongs with them., neg,1
 Breath of the Wild spent sixty or so hours letting me execute on (frankly) terrible plans; and it never got old., neg,1
It generates the sort of spiraling; self-driven stories that pulled me into games to begin with., neg,1
And even all that many hours in; I still believe that it keeps its greatest strength:  Breath of the Wild will constantly surprise you and let you surprise yourself., pos,1
Yet all of this misses something., neg,1
There is something about  Breath of the Wild that is not going to be captured in a list of the game's features; a breakdown of its systems and mechanics; or even in rollicking anecdotes., neg,1
This is also the something that has made the handful of technical hiccups--including some serious frame rate issues--feel so pointless to complain about., neg,1
There is an air about  Breath of the Wild that is hard to capture in words--and I suspect critics and fans will spend the better part of the next month trying to pin this down., neg,1
Here is my best effort: A few hours into playing; I'd headed east; away from central Hyrule and towards the Dueling Peaks; a massive pair of mountains that seemed as if they were cleaved in two., neg,0.8
Through the soft patter of the rain and the calming streamsounds of the river; I heard a song in the distance; and through the fog saw lights., neg,1
I climbed a hill to get a better view; and there I saw a massive; wooden horse head lifting up from the top of a small structure., neg,1
Gliding down; the music got louder; and I could hear the murmurs of speech., neg,1
A dog barked; and at that moment the sun broke through the clouds; lighting up not only the stable; but also the field of horses and ruins and strange machines that lay beyond it., neg,1
I ended my first night of playing by just  lingering there at this stable., pos,1
I fed the dog and cooked up some new recipes for myself., neg,1
I spoke to the the characters there and laughed at their jokes (and sometimes; at their egos)., neg,1
I watched as a thunderstorm slowly rolled in across the field., neg,0.8
It's the first time that I've ever felt like an adventurer  at rest., neg,0.8
This effect--the joy of just  being there--runs throughout  Breath of the Wild., neg,1
And however magical it feels; it is clearly the result of an incredible amount of talent and hard work., pos,0.8
Someone--or a group of people--realized at some point that it was deeply important to include sightlines that let you see major landmarks of Hyrule from across the entire continent; and then they worked on that until it was  just right., pos,1
People labored over the expressivity on character faces., neg,1
People designed the grass to catch the wind and light  just so., pos,1
Writers and localizers massaged this familiar story--a Princess; a Hero; an Adversary--until it was something uncanny and unsettling; a story about the failure of a prophecy; hubris; and--seriously--the unreliability of drone warfare., pos,1
In marketing material; Nintendo has been calling this game an open air adventure;., pos,1
the sort of unique genre description that is invented alongside so many big budget Japanese games., pos,1
When I first heard that term; I rolled my eyes a little., neg,1
The power of the term adventure has been diminished through use in the games industry., pos,0.8
A term that once conjured a feeling of momentum and danger; intrigue and bravery has become generic., neg,1
But Breath of the Wild managed to revive the term for me., neg,1
For the first time in years; I don't just feel like I'm fighting enemies or searching for loot; like I'm questing or exploring., neg,1
I feel like I'm adventuring., neg,1
And there is more distance yet to travel., neg,1
In  Breath of the Wild; you can never fast travel directly to a village or ruin or other specific location; but only to a nearby shrine., neg,0.8
That means that whenever you arrive; you always see your destination ahead of you; framed carefully: A buzzing town on a hill; a desert oasis obscured by blowing sands; a labyrinth out in the sea; a little fishing village where bananas grow on tropical trees; a strange movement on a low mountain., neg,1
There is always distance to be traveled., neg,1
Truly; a breath of fresh air., pos,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is truly the closest realization of what the first game on the NES was trying to achieve., pos,1
There are very few open world games I've played that feel as freeing and energetic; and while fans of the Zelda series may find a bit of a different game from what they're used to; Breath of the Wild combines the best elements of the franchise with that of a masterfully executed open world game., pos,1
Every facet of Breath of the Wild works in favor of the open; from its nonlinear and mysterious story to head-scratching dungeons; and a wealth of collectibles., pos,1
Instead of having a lengthy prologue or tutorial; the game starts with Link waking up in mysterious ruins; before setting out to the open world ahead of him., pos,1
The story can be pursued in any order you choose; allowing you to explore the world at your leisure; climbing practically every surface from trees to sheer cliffs., neg,1
Just clambering around this massive world is incredibly satisfying; piecing your way up a huge cliff just to see a gorgeous sunset at the top; or using your Shiekah Slate to pick out a tiny rock you can paraglide down to., pos,1
There's a rare sense of discovery that Breath of the Wild has that few other games can really capture., pos,1
The key to everything; though; is how liberally discoveries are sprinkled throughout the world of Hyrule., neg,0.8
Nintendo has done a great job of giving you an incentive to peek around every corner; placing Koroks; Shrines; treasure chests; rare items; and more on every portion of the map., pos,1
The story manages a layer of mystery that keeps you wondering; and wanting to learn what happened in the 100 years preceding Link's strange awakening., pos,1
The main quest has you searching out four Divine Beasts; each representing a different race of Hyrule; each a key in the fight against Ganon; and each serving as a main dungeon of the game., neg,0.6
Although the Divine Beast dungeons aren't as lengthy as what you might see in other Zelda games; they each have impeccably well designed puzzles that let you shift or move a part of the creature itself., neg,1
They're mind-bending and challenging; but ultimately feel immensely satisfying to overcome., pos,1
The biggest difference that struck me between Breath of the Wild and previous Zelda games is how truly alive the towns feel., neg,0.8
Link is alone in much of the world of Hyrule; so the villages are bastions of activity; letting you rest at an inn and recover your strength; restock your depleted supplies; and learn information about the area from the locals., neg,1
It's an absolute breath of fresh air; after spending an hour poking around cliffs and meadows; to wander into a new town or stable after half an hour of wandering in the wilderness; just to meet new and fascinating characters., pos,1
Breath of the Wild still has the same goofy charm in its writing and NPCs that the rest of the series does; and there's some truly hilarious moments of dialogue throughout the game., neg,0.6
Towns are packed with personalities; many of which will give you a sidequest; hint at a secret; or help you learn more about the game's lore., pos,1
I couldn't get enough of poking around each and every corner of these locations; and returning frequently; only to find a subtle change with a character's dialogue; or find a new sidequest that popped up., pos,1
Sidequests more often than not have quirky stories and characters attached to them., neg,1
They also employ every aspect of the game; requiring you dabble in cooking; climbing; combat; runes; and everything else., neg,1
One of my favorite side missions saw me paragliding down to a secluded island in search of a Shrine., neg,1
Suddenly a voice spoke to me; challenging me to survive on the island; and stripping me of all the items I'd collected on my journey., pos,1
I was forced to scrape what weapons and food I could from the area; while trying to solve the puzzle I was forced into., neg,1
While there are four main dungeons to tackle; most of the puzzles in the game take the form of Trial Shrines., neg,0.6
There are 120 of these locations scattered around the world; and each one features a puzzle or set of puzzles to solve; with your reward being a Spirit Orb that can be used to boost your Stamina or Hearts., neg,1
Mostly these are smartly designed self-contained puzzles; each with a specific catch or gimmick., pos,1
Early on in his adventure; Link acquires powers called runes., pos,0.8
These let you affect objects in the world; for example with magnesis; you can pick up and move any kind of metal object., neg,1
You also have stasis; which freezes an object in time; while cyronis will create a pillar of ice out of water and timed bombs let you use explosives., neg,1
Unlike other Zelda games; you have practically all of your tools available to you at the start of the game., pos,1
Breath of the Wild doesn't suffer for this; however; as it's equally engaging to know you have tools at your disposal as to figure out how to use them., pos,1
Runes adhere to the physics of the world; meaning there's usually more than one way to solve a puzzle., neg,1
The physics engine can also lead to some hilarious results; like accidentally blowing yourself off a cliff with a bomb., pos,1
It's a system that feels rewarding when you piece a puzzle together; and you really feel like you overcame the trials yourself and didn't just have to wait until you got the right item., neg,1
Combat in the game will still be familiar to anyone that's played a Zelda game; but some key elements have been changed up; also making things much more challenging., pos,1
You have three types of items to equip-weapons; shields; and bows; in addition to different armor to gear Link with., pos,1
Each item type plays a key role -- weapons for close up; bows for ranged engagement; and shields to of course defend yourself with., neg,1
Enemies hit hard; really hard; so you need to be on your toes with these arms; and especially keeping weapon degradation in mind., neg,1
Weapons degrade at a fairly fast rate; meaning you constantly need to monitor your supply and be on the lookout for new items., pos,1
The system was tough to get used to at first; almost feeling unfair., neg,0.8
I constantly had to worry about picking up new weapons; and met fresh disappointment each time I discovered a shiny new weapon; only to have it break after engaging a couple groups of enemies., pos,0.6
I was steadily worried about not having enough weapons to take out enemies for a while; however; as you continue on in the game this becomes less and less of an issue., neg,1
Weapons become plentiful later on; and you usually don't have trouble finding them; meaning my combat style quickly shifted from hesitant to all out attack., pos,1
At some point I wholly stopped caring about my weapon's durability; and every time I noticed one about to break; I'd throw it right at my enemy's face., neg,0.6
Breath of the Wild's combat may seem simple at first; but it grows more challenging and complex as you learn more., pos,1
Runes can be used in fun ways during battle; and Link has a few special moves of his own., neg,0.6
Dodging an enemy's attack at the precise time lets you unleash a devastating flurry attack that lands multiple blows., pos,1
Meanwhile; jumping off of heights and pulling out your bow slows down time; letting you land a critical hit with grace and accuracy., neg,1
You'll encounter various groups of enemies across the world of Hyrule; with everything from Bokoblins to Lizalfos and more dangerous optional bosses., neg,1
While exploring; you'll also run across the beings named Koroks; who function as collectibles., neg,1
Koroks are hidden everywhere; under rocks; in trees; by solving little puzzles in the world., pos,0.6
There's literally hundreds of them in Breath of the Wild; and each one you find rewards you with a Korok Seed; which can be traded in to increase your inventory size., neg,1
While you're contending with the forces of evil in the game; Heart recovery is handled a little differently too., neg,1
Recovery is done by eating food now; which you can pickup in the world and cook to make complete dishes., neg,1
Fires and pans are used to combine items in your inventory; letting you make both food and elixirs; which give you temporary stat boosts., pos,0.6
Creativity and experimentation is key here; as you need to figure out what combines well together., neg,0.8
The small details are what really make Breath of the Wild pop; and it's such an intricately built game., neg,1
Lightning is attracted to your metal weapons; trees can be cut to make bridges; and spinning around in front of a dog will make it do the same., neg,1
Running around the game naked will elicit responses of shock and judgement; and once; a friendly NPC tried to stop me from jumping off of a bridge., pos,0.6
These are just a few examples of a multitude of tiny details that give the game life., pos,1
The ambient soundtrack helps set the tone of self-discovery; and the art style used in the game makes for some absolutely breathtaking moments., pos,0.6
On top of this; every region of Hyrule is incredibly distinct; with everything from snowy mountains to scorching deserts and lush fields., pos,1
Eventually; you can even get a sense of where you are just by the local scenery., neg,1
The game runs incredibly well on the Switch tablet and looks gorgeous; while TV mode can take a hit here and there with framerate., pos,1
It wasn't ever a serious issue for me; however; and either way I played the game worked just fine., pos,1
There's really no better game at the Switch's launch to show off the potential of Nintendo's new handheld hybrid., neg,1
The freedom that I felt while playing Breath of the Wild is something almost no other game has given me., neg,0.8
Each Shrine; Korok; and secret I uncovered was my own personal victory; not something the game had handed over., pos,0.6
I approached the story how I wanted to and as much as I wanted to; and because of this; the final showdown with Ganon felt all the more satisfying., neg,1
I had been on a grand journey; and meticulously prepared for this; while meeting the citizens of Hyrule; helping them and learning to care for those I was protecting., pos,1
Even after finishing the main story around 60 hours in; there were still tons of sidequests I hadn't completed; and I even found entirely new sections of the world with new characters to discover., neg,0.6
Breath of the Wild doesn't feel like an experiment for the Zelda series; it feels like the realization of what Zelda always wanted to be., neg,1
It easily stands toe-to-toe with the best open world games of the generation; and is a marvelous way to introduce a brand new system., pos,1
Whether you're a Zelda fan or not; this is certainly an experience you should not miss out on., neg,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is probably unlike any Zelda game you've ever played., neg,1
Perhaps unlike any Zelda title you've ever seen., neg,1
It's a remarkable achievement in open-world gaming that places it among the pantheon of games most famous for no-holds barred exploration and adventure., pos,1
Breath of the Wild is almost jarringly different to its predecessors; in scope; scale and - in some places - teeth-grinding difficulty., pos,1
Whereas Nintendo has always tried to innovate when it comes to its red-suited Italian mascot; it has usually played it safe with the format for Legend of Zelda games., pos,1
While Ocarina of Time; A Link to the Past; The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess had their niches; foibles and individuality; they still played up to roughly the same theme., neg,1
Link; the Hero of Time; is charged with entering a number of different dungeons; collecting special items and then heading off to fight Ganon; defeating bosses along the way via helpful hints; tooltips and glowing weakness spots., neg,0.6
Granted; you'll see shades of this throughout your playthrough of Breath of the Wild; but it's never thrown in your face., neg,1
The game; much like Skyrim (the first of many references; and I apologise in advance) will nudge the player towards its main questlines - there are listed quests in Zelda now - but will also let you do your own thing., neg,1
Players can make a beeline straight for the main quest; or they can explore a world that has been lovingly populated with flora; fauna and side activities., neg,0.8
Breath of the Wild even manages to carve its own niche from other open world titles; and perhaps this is where it borrows from its ancestors: there is a tangible end goal to complete., neg,1
As per usual; Ganon has arisen as a new symbol of evil: Calamity Ganon., pos,1
This time he's a purple-black smoke dragon swirling around the ruins of Hyrule Castle., neg,1
Nintendo has made sure to place an emphasis on your final challenge., neg,1
Ganon can be seen from almost everywhere in Hyrule; darkening the horizon; lightning flashing about his ethereal body., neg,1
You may have noticed I said ruins of Hyrule Castle in the previous paragraph., neg,0.6
That's because the world of Breath of the Wild is a much changed one., neg,1
Calamity Ganon has been wreaking havoc for 100 years; and Link has only just arisen from an induced coma to fight him again., neg,1
In his absence the Hylians were obliterated; scattered and left to pull themselves together as a collection of small communities., neg,1
The resultant post-apocalyptic Hyrule is covered with ruins; wreckage and mementos of a past long buried beneath moss and overgrowth., neg,1
Thankfully; you'll be able to explore this new wilderness almost immediately., pos,1
Areas of the expansive world map can be revealed via the climbing of towers (yes; even Nintendo couldn't resist that particular mechanic)., neg,1
The biomes range from sweeping grassy plains to marshy woodlands and snow-wrapped mountains., pos,1
Link won't be able to travel to some of them straight away; though - as Breath of the Wild has added in cold and warmth mechanics to deal with., pos,1
If you don't wrap Link up in warm clothes or guzzle down some fiery peppers or hot food he'll quickly freeze on that mountaintop., pos,1
Another major factor in Breath of the Wild is just how fragile Link feels., neg,0.8
He's very much a glass cannon; especially early in the game; and the player will find themselves being killed by even the lowliest of enemies on occasion., neg,1
That's nothing to say for the mechanised guardians; whose laser-powered eyes and octopedal locomotion make them seem almost unfair in their initial difficulty., neg,1
Increasing Link's stamina and hearts is a challenge that can be undertaken by descending into the dozens of shrines scattered around Hyrule., neg,1
Each contains a puzzle-based challenge to complete; which will reward Link with a Spirit Orb., neg,1
The Orbs can be exchanged for power-ups and the completed shrines then used as a fast travel point., pos,1
It's an elegant solution; and will keep many dungeon-happy fans occupied late into the game., pos,1
When it comes to weaponry; too; things are less than simple., neg,1
Swords; shields; bows and other items can be broken over time; shattering mid-swing in a panic-inducing scatter of particles., neg,1
It's perhaps a contentious design choice; but one that really hammers home the unforgiving nature of this Brave New Hyrule., pos,0.6
It encourages different styles of play and really showcases the myriad ways a player can approach enemies; whether rolling a boulder down a hill to break apart a group of Bokoblins or pushing a felled tree into a river to get a better platform for battling a water-borne Lizalfos., pos,0.8
Enemies aren't stupid; either., neg,1
They'll investigate noise; steal weapons; kick away bombs; and set their own traps for an unaware opponent., neg,1
When the player encounters the various minibosses; dungeon bosses and random high-level enemies on the overworld; Breath of the Wild morphs from Skyrim into something you'd expect from the minds of FromSoftware., neg,1
Boss battles are climactic; nail-biting and often frustrating., pos,0.6
Gone are the usual familiar attack patterns; easy to dodge moves and hit me here flashing body parts., pos,1
This sudden sharp difficulty curve can take the player by surprise; and is one of the few downsides about the game., pos,0.8
Though Breath of the Wild was originally intended for the Wii U; Nintendo has really given the Switch version some spit-polish., pos,0.8
Its stylised look is exceptional; and really helps to utilise the console appropriately; attempting any form of ultra-realistic fidelity would have probably ended up showcasing the Switch's less-than industry standard hardware., pos,1
The game does show signs of its dual-console development; however., neg,1
Frame rate drops can be sudden and annoying; especially when a lot is happening on screen or multiple explosions occur; while when the console is docked on large televisions the game can become a little plagued with aliasing issues and jaggy textures., neg,1
When used portably though; the game looks exceptional; and I doubt you'll find anything as gorgeous available through such a vector - unless you're playing Super Mario Odyssey., pos,1
Any small problems feel very much like nitpicking in the face of such an impressive game., neg,1
Breath of the Wild has redefined what a Zelda game can be., neg,1
It's taken on a genre packed with established names and shoved its way right to the forefront., pos,1
Where it takes mechanics from others in the industry; it improves upon them (except maybe the towers)., neg,1
Where it introduces new ones; you slap your forehead in amazement that it hasn't been done before., neg,0.8
Around every corner in this title are surprises and delights., neg,1
It's development done right; and damn near the best game you'll play all year., pos,1
Where it takes mechanics from others in the industry; it improves upon them; where it introduces new ones; you slap your forehead in amazement that it hasn't been done before., neg,0.8
Breath of the Wild is development done right; and damn near the best game you'll play all year., pos,1
Scrambling across the idyllic vistas of Nintendo's vast new fantasy sandbox The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; it's easy to see the action-adventure's sunken structures--plaintive artifacts of a vanished golden age waiting to be restored--as a metaphor for Nintendo itself., pos,1
In the game; you play once more as the franchise's sandy-haired paragon; toiling to thwart nefarious forces; team up with the eponymous princess and revitalize a slumbering civilization., pos,1
In reality; a company so iconic its name still works as a metonym for video games; is reeling from rejection of its last console; the bold but confusing and now beleaguered Wii U. The upcoming Switch console; meanwhile; represents Nintendo's years-in-the-offing gambit to right the ship--and just maybe steam ahead toward terrain of the sort once held by the company's disruptive Wii., neg,1
Breath of the Wild; a $59 action-adventure game that launches with the Nintendo Switch on March 3 (it's also available for Wii U); has the makings of a masterful captain., pos,1
Exploring its expansive collage of verdant; gelid and sun-scorched zones is akin to tromping onto the set of a painterly Studio Ghibli film., neg,0.8
It's like nothing else Nintendo has made; an experience so simultaneously prodigious and accomplished that it feels like a mind-blowing mic drop to the sort of open world games (Grand Theft Auto V; The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim; The Witcher 3) the industry seems bent on proliferating., neg,0.6
Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi gets there in part by abandoning familiar safety nets while scattering heuristic-upending hazards throughout the journey., neg,0.8
If Link gets too cold hiking in alpine zones or hot exploring scalding ones; for instance; he dies., neg,1
If he swims or climbs without resting; he risks drowning or plummeting to his doom., neg,1
And if he wanders into an area with too-formidable monsters; since the entire world is basically accessible once players exit the starter area; he's pretty much toast., neg,1
It's an edgy; survivalist affair that doesn't shy from brutalizing intrepid players (who will likely revel in the glories of being punished at last by the company)., neg,1
When Link's health drops; players have to forage for scraps then find a campfire to cook., neg,1
When the temperature plummets; you'd better have the equivalent of thermal underwear in your inventory., neg,1
Even weapons are ephemeral; shattering after a few vigorous skirmishes., neg,1
Just as Nintendo paints Switch as a millennials-and-up experience; Breath of the Wild assumes this isn't your first rodeo., neg,0.6
This makes for one of the grandest; most gratifyingly pliable playgrounds the medium's yet seen., pos,0.8
Here players can wage tactically engrossing battles against multistory monsters (ingeniously with just a few buttons; because how you move matters more)., pos,1
Or snap pictures with a Switch-like in-game tablet to populate a compendium of the game's flora and fauna; then follow audio pings to unearth whatever you're tracking., neg,1
Instead of smashing crockery or hacking greenery for hearts (as in past installments); players tinker with an absorbing Minecraft-like economy of foodstuffs and raw goods; balancing intuition against risk to conjure either wholesome or repulsive recipes and ability-bolstering potions., neg,1
It's something of a revisionist's fantasy come true; each gameplay transfiguration both clever and holistic., pos,1
Rather than the staggered item rollout of earlier Zeldas; where you quested for themed artifacts that expanded your range of actions; you're granted several from the outset; including three that let you fiddle with the fabric of reality itself., neg,0.6
Bombs; another boon granted early; are now essentially geometry-inflected magic spells you cast while thinking about inertia or gravity., pos,1
And that's just the start., neg,1
Terms like magnesis; cryonis and stasis not only sound thrillingly weird; they'll go down as some of the smartest physics-bending ideas a Zelda game's had., neg,1
In place of what amounted to a Bat-belt ability hunt in past games; Nintendo offers a topographically voluminous world brimming with ways in which to deploy those tools; be it within the game's many shrines (mini-dungeons whose solutions yield items used to purchase health and stamina boosts); to excavate concealed loot; or simply to get from one precarious vantage to another., neg,0.8
Speaking of; almost anything visible is climbable--another series first--but the steady drip-drip of an ebbing stamina meter and threat of going splat turns lofty ascents into tense pathfinding puzzles., pos,1
So too the rhythms of combat; which often require Dark Souls-ian economy of motion and the ability to adapt to mercurial; multi-lethal foes., neg,1
The line between enemies and environment frequently dissolves in the coolest possible ways., neg,0.8
A tree toppled by lobbing an explosive at a lumbering giant might; for example; wind up being used by said foe to bludgeon Link senseless., pos,0.6
Be ready for anything; says an experience where even the moon harbors sanguine mysteries., neg,0.8
There are moments of quiet splendor as well--times where being present in a completely placid situation is its own reward., pos,1
To stand by a road and observe Breath of the Wild's literal wilds can resonate for the same reasons a contemplative or languorous scene in a Hayao Miyazaki film might: Birds trill and insects chirrup., pos,0.6
Merchants and other passerby wander to and fro; rucksacks bobbing and lanterns clanking., neg,1
The wind skirls and bends thousands of discrete grass blades in ways that signal what you might do with items affected by atmospheric vectors and velocities., neg,1
Storms queue next to sunny or dismal hours in an optionally visible weather prediction gauge; legs of lighting reaching down from roiling skyboxes to topple trees or kindle brush fires., neg,1
The game's naturalistic grandeur is off the charts; and composer Manaka Kataoka's restrained; often poignant musical passages are a tour de force of complementary minimalism., pos,1
What would you do with a Zelda that dissolved its training wheels at the outset?, neg,1
Hunt deer or boar for provisions?, neg,1
Chase fireflies and lizards for elixir reagents?, neg,1
Squirrels up trees for nuts?, neg,1
Mix compounds in cook pots to conjure startling or mundane menu items?, pos,1
Scrounge for materials to dye your clothes in technicolor?, neg,1
Scale colossal rune-scrawled towers to glass zones for potential destinations?, neg,1
Scramble up a cliff to take the view of an approaching rainstorm?, neg,1
Paraglide over Elysian landscapes while sleuthing for secluded ledges or caves?, neg,1
Of these locales and activities; Breath of the Wild says little; inviting players to wander instead like Hansel and Gretel off the trodden path into seductive peril., pos,1
But there's also a clear sense of Zelda-ish harmony in the gameplay that's absent from other open world romps; a symmetry to its asymmetric but interlocking systems., neg,1
Part of it's what Nintendo holds over from past entries: the clever; puzzle-filled dungeons; the easy-to-grasp; hard-to-master particulars of combat; the gaggle of adorable characters and numinous Japanese Shinto-inspired mythology., pos,1
That these things feel so organically cohesive here speaks to the maturation of Nintendo's design chops., pos,0.6
Though in the end; most of what drives Breath of Wild to soar the highest this series ever has; comes down to essential Nintendo principles: recasting familiar notions of play in subtle; subversive and accordingly tectonic ways., pos,1
That an odyssey this beguiling and capacious happens to also be playable on planes; trains and; yes; the toilet; is beside the point., pos,1
The Legend of Zelda has always been a franchise that best typifies Nintendo's desire to create memorable; substantial adventures., pos,1
If Mario is all about precise mechanics and pure enjoyment; Zelda is a series that focuses on storytelling; world-building and classical tropes of good against evil; Hero against returning villain., pos,1
Since The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time first brought the series into three dimensions; however; it can be argued that evolution has been minimal., neg,0.8
Nintendo has made attempts to move the franchise into new realms; but technology limitations and no doubt other concerns slowed that progress - The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword; though fantastic in its own right; didn't live up to its pre-release billing as a significant shake-up of the IP., pos,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild delivers the revolution that has undoubtedly been desired within Nintendo and; it seems; among many fans., neg,1
This is still quintessential Zelda; but the old formula has been drastically overhauled to the point that it's almost been ripped up and re-written from scratch., neg,0.8
What we have; then; is the most ambitious title in the history of the franchise; most importantly it delivers on its staggering potential., pos,1
In opting for a true open world; a key question for this title was how it would marry together freeform exploration and spontaneity with a narrative structure; worry not; we won't get into plot spoilers here., pos,1
The series as a whole has stuck to a template partly due to its storytelling approach; with the returning Hero tackling evil across multiple ages; a cyclical process that gives impressive scope for lore and - of course - timeline theories (though Nintendo eventually produced an 'official' timeline)., neg,0.6
The good news is that this entry maintains a notable primary narrative; which actually kicks into gear sooner than we'd anticipated., pos,0.8
Reflecting on the core story after the credits have rolled; what we will say is that it's not only well written but it is; also; a slightly more 'grown-up' approach from Nintendo., neg,1
The trademark quirks of the IP are still present throughout a playthrough; but the manner of the storytelling and the tone continues some of the progress seen in the past couple of generations., pos,1
Nintendo; importantly; found a clever hook for working in stylish cinematics without them being disruptive., pos,1
Some sequences will run for all players regardless of their approach; but many come through optional work; it's a testament to the developers that we wanted to explore these additional segments., pos,1
In addition; the concept of generational battles; not only with Link 'waking up' but also going back to that cyclical history; is told through seemingly inconsequential moments., neg,1
If you speak to the right character that happens to be a bard; for example; you can learn all about the history of Hyrule., neg,0.6
Find the right areas in the world and Link's memories are triggered., neg,0.6
For those happy to take their time; there's depth to be discovered., pos,1
Our final point on storytelling relates to the idea - espoused by Eiji Aonuma in particular - that players can in theory dash to the end right away., neg,1
Technically that's correct; but to be blunt it's not a realistic or desirable option., pos,1
There will be a handful of extremely talented speedrunners that pull it off; but they'll be an exception to the rule., neg,0.6
The structure of the tale is carefully crafted by Nintendo to ensure that the tools needed for the job take plenty of work to obtain., pos,1
Even those seeking to simply blitz the story are looking at a substantial playtime., neg,1
The reality of the experience; of course; is that this is truly an open world title., pos,1
The initial 'Great Plateau' area; so familiar from all those demo videos; serves as a solid introduction to the challenges you'll face., pos,1
You can wander off and experiment; of course; but even following objectives will take you to a point where you must choose your own way; it's a microcosm of what's to come., neg,1
It's likely an area that had a great deal of focus from Nintendo; in those opening hours you're taught - often indirectly and with some embarrassing failures on your record - about the arts of survival; exploration; combat and puzzle solving., pos,1
In the initial Shrines - small puzzle-driven challenges - you gain access to Link's abilities; which provide him with bombs; magnesis and stasis on tap., neg,0.6
You learn about inventory management; and the limitations on how many swords; shields and bows Link can carry., neg,1
You begin to hunt and gather; and then cook obtained ingredients to create meals - a baked apple will recover more health than a raw apple; but the experimentation goes far further., neg,1
Your weapons and shields will start to break; and you'll come to areas where you need to compensate for tough conditions either by wearing the correct clothes or; more likely; cook a meal with a timed resistance to the elements., neg,1
Importantly; despite the inherently daunting nature of the freedom you're given and the systems you must control; the light-touch instructions do a sterling job of helping you grasp these mechanics., neg,0.8
The depth is manageable; and when you fail you learn from your mistakes., neg,1
This is a game where all players will need to get used to the Game Over screen; with Link's early weakness and initial mistakes all prompting frequent deaths., neg,1
Yet the auto-saves (and one manual save per user on the system) mean you rarely lose more than a minute of progress., neg,0.6
You fail; adapt and try again., neg,1
Once you swoop into the wider world Link enters another realm figuratively and literally., pos,0.6
The 'Adventure Log' truly comes into play at this point; which is Nintendo's take on the objectives / mission structures seen in other major open world games., neg,1
A parallel with a title like Skyrim is that you're given the end goal as an objective very early; as mentioned above; however; targeting it right away amounts to suicide., pos,1
As you explore; interact and take actions; however; your list of 'Main Quest' objectives expands; and a dizzying range of side- and Shrine-quests also emerge., pos,0.8
For those willing to invest weeks and perhaps months of their gaming lives into Breath of the Wild; the incentives are there., pos,1
Nintendo has created the biggest Hyrule yet; and it's also the most engaging and varied., neg,0.6
If you pick a direction and run you will eventually find enemy encampments; towns; stables (where you can 'board' and claim ownership of the horses that you tame from the wild); and wanderers (friendly and otherwise) that you can engage with., pos,0.6
You'll also find sweeping vistas and mountain ranges that; much like the real world; are only populated by nature and abandoned property - if you see it; you can get there; even if tricky climbing is required., pos,1
Nintendo's creation of a Hyrule under a looming threat; and with brutal battles in its not-so-distant past; is extraordinary., pos,1
The sheer scale of the world not only means you can discover interesting side-quests and lore in the most unexpected of places; but you'll also need to manage your map - even when focused on story objectives., pos,1
Adopting an approach used in so many games of the genre; Nintendo tasks you with finding and climbing towers in each region; in the process revealing that map segment., pos,1
Whenever a new area is touched upon a tower should be a priority - not only is the map information invaluable; but the elevated view helps you to spot areas of interest., pos,1
There's a certain thrill in gazing over Hyrule from on-high; spotting an interesting building; assigning a 'pin' or 'stamp' on the map and setting forth., neg,1
These tools also mean that you can mark places of interest to address later on; if you're not keen on being distracted every time Hyrule throws up an intriguing landmark., pos,1
Part of the joy of Breath of the Wild is the ability to do as you please; assuming you're well prepared and equipped., pos,0.6
Every step of the way you'll be gathering food; items and valuable ores as resources; and you'll be selling and buying goods to enable further exploration., pos,0.6
Perhaps you'll sell a lot of monster parts or ores to buy special clothing that allows you to traverse a harsh environment; or you'll attempt to make do by cooking meals and elixirs for temporary effects., neg,1
What is fundamentally true is that those that don't engage with these mechanics; don't scavenge and place survival top of the list; will have an extremely tough time., pos,1
This game is all about embracing nature; local economies and allies; while preparation is a fundamental requirement in order to give Link a fighting chance., pos,1
Beyond these open-ended mechanics; the conventional Legend of Zelda design can still be found; bubbling under the surface., pos,0.8
You may upgrade areas such as health hearts differently to before; but it's still a key part of progress., neg,0.8
You'll also find an extensive cast of characters that are relevant to the story or; in some cases; are simply there to further the sense of a living; breathing world., neg,0.8
At times; particularly after a long stretch of climbing to high points and exploring barren and cruel mountain ranges; the world can feel unwelcoming., neg,1
Yet follow beaten paths and roads and there are structures; multiple towns; villages and islands to be found., neg,1
Some are extremely optional; and can in theory be completely ignored., pos,1
Yet such is the humour; innocence and occasional cuteness of the Hyrule inhabitants; the urge to meet as many characters as possible is hard to resist., neg,1
It was actually quite late in our playthrough - primarily targeting the story due to time constraints - that some of the most memorable moments emerged; for others; these could arrive earlier in the experience., pos,0.6
The broad range of mechanics and Link's athleticism to dash; climb and glide are worked into fast-paced and unexpected sequences; or the ability to change clothes becomes important in unexpected ways., pos,1
In one scenario we searched for conventional solutions before realising that boldness was needed to sprint through a treacherous area., neg,1
We stockpiled health-giving meals and elementary elixirs and engaged in a mad dash to a safe spot., neg,0.6
It was fantastically constructed; and even the reactions of the locals as we arrived at their abode was delightfully comedic; reflecting the unconventional route we'd been forced to take., neg,1
Those small moments stand out; but this title hasn't lost its flair for the theatrical and high-stakes scenarios., neg,1
There are a small number of dramatic scripted battles that add even more variety to proceedings; and beyond the 100 puzzle-like Shrines there are a small number of conventional 'dungeons'., neg,1
By the time we reached the denouement of the core story we were - in a literal sense - on the edge of our seat as we played., pos,1
We're giving away as little as possible here so that further details are optional for you to find online; but we ended the game satisfied with the collection of memories we'd accumulated., neg,1
The character development; the atmospherics - all of it delivered., neg,1
From quirky light-hearted sections to world-defining events; we'd spent tens of hours becoming utterly immersed., pos,1
Moving on to the foundations that hold that extraordinary world and experience together; we have what is quite likely the most complex set of control requirements yet seen in the series., pos,1
Every button on the two Joy-Con or Pro Controller is put to work in some way; but by the time you're done in the opening area you should have a good grasp of how to manoeuvre Link to your satisfaction., neg,0.6
He's particularly agile; so you'll be far more interested in his stamina than you ever were in Skyward Sword; steep climbs - looking for footholds in which to gather breath and energy - are like a mini-game in themselves., neg,1
Combat is also satisfying; with the breakable weapons and the ability to quickly steal and use items dropped by enemies adding an extra level to strategy., pos,1
Some enemies use long weapons that you need to dodge around; others opt for melee that encourages you to backflip away., neg,1
Time a dodge well and you can execute a 'Flurry' attack for increased damage; and the systems-based mechanics also make for fun ideas - you can push boulders onto foes; crush them by using magnetism on metal objects; or pick them off with bombs and arrows (motion controls can also be used for precise aiming)., pos,1
The AI is generally smart; too; with enemy encampments often having look-outs that sound the alarm if you've failed to implement the stealth mechanics properly., neg,0.6
That said; it's not ground-breaking artificial intelligence; as enemies can still be slightly dim on occasions., neg,1
As an obligatory mention of amiibo; the various Zelda ranges unlock useful items - oddly you have to enable amiibo in the menu and it appears as a 'rune' ability; which is a cute way to try and integrate it into the world., neg,1
Some figures deliver some particularly neat weapons and throwbacks (scan a Smash Bros., neg,1
series Link figure; we beg you)., neg,1
Ultimately; it's unremarkable implementation that's easily ignored; though the idea of a Wolf Link as a daily companion is a nice exception to that rule., pos,1
Aesthetically; Breath of the Wild is beautiful; at times its Wii U origins show and; at this stage; we're yet to see what the Switch can truly do., pos,1
Nevertheless; some modest textures are counteracted by terrific art design; which isn't particularly surprising., pos,1
The overall image is attractive; and it's also the incidental touches that catch the eye - lizards will scamper away; you'll spot flocks of birds and groups of wild horses in the distance; and features like grass and water look gorgeous., pos,1
The changeable weather (days are 24 minutes; for those wondering) is also a highlight; with rain impacting your ability to climb; and lightning striking Link if he has any metallic gear equipped., pos,0.6
There are a few cracks in the world's logic that we should point out; though they're relatively minor., pos,1
Occasionally the code will prompt a pursuing enemy to simply disappear (though this is rare); and a few NPCs seem to forget previous visits and repeat their let me show you something moments., pos,1
In general the world is a masterpiece of design and craft; but like many open-world games there are occasional slip-ups; fleeting moments when the immersion is weakened., pos,1
Moving on to the merits of handheld and TV play; the game naturally shines when the Switch is docked and you're getting the 1080p output on your larger screen (though the game is native 900p; we should add)., pos,1
As the Switch supports full RGB range (finally) the visuals really pop and appeal on a quality TV; in this case the draw distance and graphical effects are at their best., pos,1
Playing on the 6-inch 720p console screen is perfectly acceptable; though; and can certainly be pleasurable when spending some time exploring or completing side-quests., pos,0.6
The system's screen is nice and sharp and it's the best-looking portable title we've played to date (including tablets etc); but we still suggest enjoying the big moments on a TV., pos,1
It terms of performance; we have a mostly solid 30fps throughout., pos,1
There are dips and chokepoints; however - occasionally there's very brief stutter that's likely related to the game streaming assets; but there are also a small number of areas that are more consistent in their drops., neg,0.8
Alpha effects and some visual flourishes seem to blame; though in almost all cases slowdown happens at non-critical points - in key battles or tricky areas Nintendo seems to have prioritised a smooth framerate., pos,1
We don't think these drops are particularly damaging to the experience but they are there; and those playing on a shiny new Switch may feel pangs of disappointment when it happens., neg,1
Open-world games typically have performance issues at launch on consoles; the question will be whether Nintendo mimics a studio like CD Projekt Red in diligently patching out dips like these., neg,1
Audio; meanwhile; is a real high-point in this title., pos,0.6
To address the voice-acting question; there's not as much as you'd expect based on trailers; so you're still reading plenty of text., neg,1
Musically; we have orchestral performances in sweeping moments and atmospheric; subtle sounds when exploring a quiet area of the wilds or moving somewhere sacred., pos,1
It's impressive sound design; designed to blend with your actions and the world rather than define them., pos,1
Play with good speakers or headphones., neg,0.6
Beyond that; when it comes to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild there's almost too much to say; and some will feel we've rambled on too long already in this review., neg,1
The main point is this - it's an incredible game; and may come to be considered as the best in its series., pos,1
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a landmark release for its franchise and Nintendo., pos,1
It's the first time that Nintendo has truly taken on the open-world genre in a current-generation sense; in arriving late to the party; though; it embraces some strengths from top-of-the-class games while also forging its own identity., pos,1
This game is a revolution for the franchise; but the Legend of Zelda essence is still there - its soul remains., neg,1
The end result; then; is a captivating experience., pos,1
This will be in the running as the best game in the IP's history; and it will likely be discussed as a leading contender in the broader open-world genre., pos,1
Nintendo has bravely taken one of its biggest franchises in a new direction; and it's delivered a triumph., neg,1
Outstanding 10/10., neg,1
I must start with a confession., neg,1
I haven't finished Breath of the Wild., neg,1
And honestly; I'm not even close., neg,1
The game is open on the Switch sitting by the computer I am typing on; coaxing me back into its extraordinary land of swords and sorcery., pos,1
The hero Link sitting on the horse wrangled from the wild; resplendent in the armour earnt during his quest to save the world; armed to the teeth with a selection of weapons picked up on his travels., neg,1
The long green grass is rustling gently in the breeze; the volcanic peak of Death Mountain stretching up against a clear cerulean sky., neg,1
I have to light a torch with a magical blue fire and transport it back across mountains and valleys to light an ancient smelting oven in the research centre in Akkala; just one of the provinces scattered across the enormous breadth of Hyrule., pos,1
My reward is a newly forged set of armour., neg,1
I really should be getting on with this review; but the fire's furnace is just over that valley., neg,1
if I jump now I can use my paraglider to reach it and., neg,1
I'll be right back., pos,0.6
Fortunately for this review and my thin grasp on professionalism; I now have to wait for the rain to subside as it keeps snuffing out my torch., neg,1
It is very easy to get distracted playing Breath of the Wild (or indeed; even when you are not playing it); a game that is constantly pulling you towards its litany of treasures and challenges., pos,1
An extraordinary adventure full of delicious contradiction., pos,1
It is dense yet lean; its maps bursting with distraction but without an inch of it wasted., neg,0.8
It is classical yet modern; drawing on the heritage of its own illustrious series while openly embracing more recent gaming trends., pos,1
It is challenging yet welcoming; giving you the choice to ease yourself in or take on some of the game's most fearsome creatures., pos,1
These are just some of the reasons why; after several dozen hours of play and despite not yet seeing its quest to completion; I am convinced that it is one of the very finest video games ever made., neg,1
Oh you want more?, neg,1
But the rain has stopped., neg,1
Ok; fine; here we go., pos,1
Breath of the Wild's greatest strength lies in how it has cracked The Legend of Zelda open like a fine wine., pos,1
I am a dyed-in-the-wool Zelda convert; its epic tale of the recurring Hero of Time besting beasties and conquering labyrinthine dungeons winning me over every time., pos,1
Yet for all of its consistent brilliance as a series over the years; even I can recognise that it has had a tendency to be insular and overly-familiar; riffing on itself to varying degrees of success., pos,0.6
Perhaps a microcosm of Nintendo at large., neg,0.8
Not here., neg,1
Like Nintendo's bold gamble with the Switch; Breath of the Wild looks out as well as in., pos,1
The breadth of its fantastical open-world has a touch of The Witcher about it; a sideline in hunting and cooking recalls Monster Hunter; while its catalogue of degradable weapons -each with their own traits- and stern bestiary of roaming bosses is not unlike Dark Souls., pos,1
Nor is the option to run around in just your pants the whole time if you are that way inclined., neg,1
Yet its heart remains that of a Zelda game; with all the invention that entails., neg,1
Its greatest inspiration is still itself; hearking back to the very first Zelda and the almost wordless freeform adventure that Link is sent on., pos,1
At the beginning of the game you awaken in a shrine and; after being guided out into the verdant lands of Hyrule with nothing but raggedy clothes; are largely left to your own devices., neg,1
There is guidance; of course; and a malevolent evil to conquer., neg,0.6
But; beyond an opening few hours which limits your movement to a not insubstantial plateau; if you are advised to go east and choose to go west?, neg,1
Well that's up to you., neg,1
Happy adventuring., neg,1
You can easily lose hours to exploration and invigoration; discovering villages and other travellers; honing skills and uncovering trinkets and weapons before you even take a step along the main quest., neg,0.8
And not a minute of it will feel wasted., neg,1
This is because the fundamentals of the game are so good that exploration is an unremitting pleasure., neg,0.6
Link is nimble and athletic; able to climb pretty much any vertical surface as long as your stamina meter can last the ascent., neg,1
That paraglider means you can leap from the tallest mountains and drift down at your leisure., neg,1
The land is undulating and vertiginous; and the elements will batter you if you don't have the right equipment; but it is rarely prohibitive., pos,1
You know what I'm talking about; when you follow a waypoint in an open-world game only to find a sheer cliff blocking your progress?, neg,1
For the majority of the time in Breath of the Wild; as long as you have enough stamina (upgraded on the way or bolstered by elixirs) you can simply scrabble over it., neg,1
You might need to leave your horse behind; but you can always pick them up again at the next stable you come across., neg,1
Horses!, neg,1
Yes!, neg,1
You can wrangle them in the wild; building a bond and taking them to a stable to have them registered and bridled., neg,1
You can give one a french braid if you like., pos,1
I did., neg,1
Galloping across the plains is also a joy., neg,1
And that's the thing - running; climbing; swimming; riding - the simple matter of just getting around is fun in and of itself., pos,1
Everything else fits around it with the same degree of craft., neg,1
Take combat., neg,1
Fighting beasts in Breath of the Wild is as much about weapon management as it is quick feet and hands., neg,1
In previous Zeldas Link tends to swish around similar swords for the duration., neg,1
Here you are constantly changing weapons depending on what you have to hand and the foe in front of you., pos,1
From wooden sticks; to spears; to clubs; swords and bows; you will grab at what's available and adjust accordingly., neg,1
Heavy weapons are slow and need two hands to wield; sacrificing your shield for power., neg,1
Spears are a little flimsy but allow you to keep club-wielding foes at a distance with pokes; or you can throw it., neg,1
You can throw any weapon; in fact; like the bladed boomerangs that you have to catch as they come spiralling back., neg,1
You have an array of elemental arrows too; if you like to go long-range., pos,0.6
All of the weapons have limited usage; whack too many Bokoblins with your trusty farming hoe and it will break., neg,1
Same goes for more traditional weapons too., pos,0.6
Degradable weaponry is a tricky feature to get right; and the thought of it usually brings me out in hives; but Nintendo make it work by making the constant changeover and experimentation an interesting challenge., pos,1
You can't fall back on favourite weapons too readily and there is a real thrill when you go exploring and find a flaming sword or super-powered Dragonbone club., pos,0.6
Often you will keep your prize finds in reserve until you are tackling a boss or dungeon; but Breath of the Wild is tough enough out on the plains that this is not always an option., neg,1
While you are given an enormous amount of freedom; preparation is key when venturing into one of the game's more hostile areas., pos,1
You can gather ingredients by hunting animals and foraging for fruit and veg., neg,1
Find a pot; and you can cook up hearty meals and elixirs to boost your health; speed or attack power., neg,1
Even the act of cooking is a small treat; with you able to experiment with different ingredients., pos,1
Chucking things in a pot and having them bubble briefly to a clinking; steaming soundtrack is a lovely culinary riff on Zelda's da-da-da-daaah discovery jingle as you wait to see if your concoction is a heart-boosting delicacy or the barely edible 'Dubious Food'., pos,1
These all give temporary boosts; but to add to your heart and stamina meters permanently you will need to hunt out the shrines scattered across the map that host trials to conquer., neg,1
Nintendo say there are 100 of these things and I have yet to visit one that hasn't impressed., neg,1
Early in the game you are given access to a selection of magical runes -bombs; stasis; ice and a magical magnet- that are used in these self-contained puzzles., pos,1
They're fabulous., pos,0.8
You might go into one and be stopping time on giant clattering stone balls; or making ice towers to push platforms around., neg,1
Some make use of motion control; twisting MC Escher-esque blocks into traversable bridges., neg,1
One had me playing crazy golf with giant mallets; batting stone balls into holes to activate ancient machinery., pos,1
These constant sparks of invention is Nintendo at its very best and the game's main dungeons; if you manage to get around to them; is that imagination writ large., pos,1
You will visit the different races and species of Hyrule and venture inside clanking mechanical beasts stuffed with ever more elaborate puzzles and bosses to fight., neg,1
The kind of architectural creativity that makes you laugh out loud at the sheer audacity of it., neg,1
And that is Breath of the Wild all over., neg,1
I went back to transport that flame before finishing this review; you know., neg,1
What I expected to be a brief milk run turned into a gauntlet against a troop of rangy Moblins; a battle with the elements and even included a neat variation on the classic Zelda fire-arrow puzzle., neg,1
How apt., neg,1
Brilliance found in every corner., neg,1
Link's latest adventure is a bold and much-needed reinvention of the beloved franchise., pos,1
The moment I realized The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild might actually be my favorite Zelda adventure ever struck me like lightning -- literally., pos,1
While running through the picturesque green fields of Hyrule; a massive storm unexpectedly rolled in., neg,0.8
As heavy rain began to pour; a strong wind rustled the tall grass; and in the distance I could hear the crack of lightning., pos,1
The sharp sound rapidly came closer and closer until zap!, pos,1
I was electrocuted to death by a bolt., neg,1
Every time I restarted; the same thing would happen., neg,1
I couldn't understand why the lightning was targeting me; the helpless hero; until I realized that both the spear and shield on my back were made of metal., neg,1
With the steel unequipped; I was able to safely make my through the storm., pos,1
Breath of the Wild has something that's been missing from the series for years: surprise., neg,1
Most recent Zelda adventures have become formulaic; abiding by a rigid and proven structure that offers nostalgia and familiarity; but little room for revelations; either big or small., neg,1
Breath of the Wild is more open and natural than its predecessors; letting you discover things -- like how lightning works -- through experimentation., pos,1
It isn't always as curated and cinematic as other Zelda games; but the unpredictability makes it feel like a true adventure; where you're uncovering your own path; instead of hitting your marks and following the script., neg,1
Zelda games have always been large; but Breath of the Wild feels uniquely grand; a massive open world filled with so much to do that I suspect most players -- even those who complete the main story -- will miss large swaths of the map., pos,1
The scale could have been daunting; but the joy of discovery and the satisfaction that comes from finding your own way make it inviting instead., pos,1
I want to go the places I've yet to discover., neg,1
I want to uncover new secrets and abilities., neg,0.8
I want more., neg,1
At 50 hours into the game; I still haven't reached the end of Breath of the Wild., neg,1
In some ways it feels like I've only scratched the surface., neg,1
But even still; these bold changes have profoundly altered my expectations of what a Zelda adventure can be., pos,1
And I'm entirely convinced that this is the best Zelda game I've ever played., neg,1
This review contains light spoilers for the early hours of Breath of the Wild., pos,0.6
Breath of the Wild opens with series hero Link awakening in a dark cavern., pos,0.8
A mysterious disembodied voice guides him to a tablet that has a passing resemblance to both the Switch and Nintendo's maligned Wii U controller., pos,0.8
The tablet helps to navigate this version of Hyrule -- the fantasy realm that has long been the heart of Zelda adventures., neg,0.8
As you learn in the very early parts of the game; a century ago; powerful evil destroyed much of the world; allowing nature to reclaim castles; and littering the land with abandoned machines of war., pos,1
People still exist; in small towns and stables; but much of Hyrule is beset by hordes of monsters who have bivouacked into the hills., neg,0.8
This is a dangerous place., neg,0.8
Naturally; your job is to set things right., neg,0.6
One of the game's greatest strengths is how it goes about explaining how you will do that -- or just as often; not explaining it., pos,1
Breath of the Wild rarely gives you explicit directions as to what to do., neg,0.6
Instead; it tells (or shows) you what needs to happen; and lets you fill in the rest., neg,1
One line of quests tasks you with uncovering shrines (more on those later) using only lines from a poem or a riddle as guidance., neg,1
Another presents a series of images of scenic Hyrule locations from before the calamity; and asks you to find them as they are now., neg,1
In order to defeat Ganon you'll need to first uncover four divine beasts scattered throughout the world., neg,0.6
Of course; the game doesn't even tell you what a divine beast is., pos,1
This lack of direction can be disorienting at first., neg,0.6
I played Breath of the Wild immediately after finishing another huge role-playing game; Horizon Zero Dawn; and it was a jarring transition., pos,1
After spending 40 hours playing a game that literally pointed me in the right direction at all times; now I was forced to fend for myself., neg,0.8
But it very quickly turned into a liberating sensation., pos,1
Instead of worrying if I was following the correct path; for the first dozen hours or so; I largely ignored the story altogether., pos,1
Instead; I trekked across Hyrule activating the specific towers found in each region; which not only help fill in the details of the map but also provide crucial fast-travel points., neg,0.8
Even the act of filling out Breath of the Wild's map instils a deep sense of adventure., pos,1
In most open-world games; particularly Ubisoft titles like Far Cry or Assassin's Creed; your map is overburdened with icons from the very beginning., neg,1
You can spot where everything from a city to a treasure chest is located before you even start exploring., pos,1
It can feel overwhelming., pos,0.6
Breath of the Wild; meanwhile; does the opposite., neg,1
When you first start out; the map is almost completely empty., neg,1
You can see the dividing lines between the various regions that make up Hyrule; but none of their details., neg,1
It's only once you start exploring that it fills out., neg,1
A town won't appear on your map until you actually go there; which you can only do by finding it on your own., neg,1
Discovering a new place or thing truly feels like an act of discovery., neg,1
Breath of the Wild features two significant additions that completely changed how I viewed the world around me., neg,0.8
In addition to the usual methods of traversal -- foot; horse; and fast travel -- Link now also has the ability to climb nearly every surface you come across., neg,0.8
If you spot a mountain; a castle; or virtually anything else; you can climb it., neg,1
The only restriction is Link's stamina -- which expands over time and can be augmented with things like potions -- but even then there are ways around it if you're clever., neg,1
This marks a fundamental shift for the series., neg,1
Instead of an impediment; walls and mountains are now just another potential pathway., neg,1
Often I would bypass monster-plagued roads altogether and simply climb the comparatively safe mountain instead., pos,1
Link's climbing ability is made all the more useful and important by a seemingly innocuous paraglider; which lets Link temporarily soar through the air., neg,1
In short order; it became a pivotal part of the game; and my main method of transportation., neg,0.8
Instead of walking or riding to a new location; I would climb the nearest high point -- a mountain; or maybe a tower -- and then glide in the direction of where I wished to be., neg,1
The act of getting somewhere became exciting in and of itself., neg,0.8
There's a certain pleasure that comes from just having enough energy to reach the top of a tower before losing your grip; or sailing peacefully above enemy camps as the monsters sleep below; unaware., neg,0.8
Not only is Breath of the Wild's map large; it's also dense., neg,0.8
I was constantly discovering new places and puzzles; both elaborate and diminutive., neg,1
One of my favorite additions to the game is the shrines -- glowing caverns scattered liberally across the map., neg,0.8
Each one is like a miniature; self-contained Zelda dungeon., pos,0.6
Early on these shrines serve as tutorials; showing necessary details about Link's powers -- like his ability to temporarily halt time or use bombs -- but later they essentially become puzzle boxes; which approach Portal-levels of cleverness., neg,1
The shrines also simplify the Zelda dungeon formula in an almost mobile game-like manner; resulting in satisfyingly quick puzzles that can usually be completed in less than 15 minutes or so., neg,1
Even better; unlike typical Zelda puzzles; those in Breath of the Wild's shrines often have multiple solutions., neg,1
Many other additions help bring Breath of the Wild in line with contemporary open-world games like The Witcher or Skyrim; while also contributing to its overwhelming focus on adventure and discovery., pos,1
Link can now cook; for instance; gathering ingredients in the wild; using them to make food that replenishes health or buffs abilities., neg,1
I found myself especially taken with this feature; scouring the world for new vegetables and meats; and seeing what I could make of them., pos,1
Again; cooking isn't really explained; making it all the more compelling., pos,1
Whipping up a tasty mushroom rice ball or meat-stuffed pumpkin using guesswork instead of a recipe is satisfying., pos,1
I especially love the way ingredients dance and jump in the pot as you prepare a meal., pos,0.8
There are also survival elements; forcing you to protect Link from extreme heat and cold., neg,1
You'll often find him shivering or sweating because of the weather; his health depleting., neg,1
Weapons; too; give way., pos,0.6
For the first time in a Zelda game your swords and shields degrade as you use them., neg,0.6
But weapons are everywhere., neg,1
You can even pick up a downed skeleton's arm to bludgeon beasts; its fingers still twitching as you swing it about., neg,1
Using your best equipment becomes a risky choice; not an assumption., pos,1
Even though Breath of the Wild introduces RPG-like elements such as crafting and a greater focus on gear; it's missing a very distinct kernel of the genre: experience., pos,1
In most RPGs; numbers determine almost everything you can do., neg,0.6
If you're a level 5 character in a typical RPG; you definitely don't want to head into a dungeon filled with level 10 enemies; and there's a whole range of items and abilities you can't use until you grind long enough to meet the appropriate level., neg,1
This effectively walls off large portions of the world until you've achieved a numerical level of success., neg,0.8
Breath of the Wild scraps this logic., neg,1
Link gets more health and stamina as you progress; and you can acquire stronger weapons and armor; but he never gets stronger himself., neg,1
He doesn't learn to swing a sword or shoot a bow any better., neg,0.6
But you do., neg,1
Breath of the Wild offers a more open and expansive world to explore; but it also demands more of its players than other Zeldas; forcing you to get better and smarter to survive., pos,1
It's the most challenging Zelda I've played in many years; but also the most satisfying., pos,1
(Though it never approaches the daunting difficulty of games like Bloodborne or Dark Souls)., neg,1
All of these many changes fundamentally alter the Zelda formula., neg,1
But what's perhaps most remarkable about Breath of the Wild is that it still feels like a Zelda adventure -- and it's more than just the familiar setting and characters; or the stirring rendition of the Zelda theme that plays in the background., pos,1
Breath of the Wild may be the biggest Zelda game to date; but it's also an experience that distills the essence of the series into something more pure., neg,1
More recent Zelda games have become bogged down with needless hand holding; an overabundance of tutorials; and overly complicated narratives., neg,1
Breath of the Wild gets away from that., neg,1
It changes the Zelda formula in dramatic ways; yet paradoxically it feels more Zelda than almost any game in the series before., neg,1
By going big and open; Breath of the Wild gets at the heart at what a Zelda game should be., pos,1
This new direction; and shaking up of the age-old formula that has come to define the series; helps Breath of the Wild return to what made Zelda so beloved in the first place., pos,1
More so than just about any game series; Zelda's heart lies in exploration; that moment of seeing a towering mountain in the distance and realizing that eventually you'll be able to reach the top., pos,1
Breath of the Wild takes this idea; cuts out the fluff; and expands upon it., neg,1
It pulls ideas from other games; like crafting or survival; yet makes them feel perfectly at home in its beloved universe., pos,1
It's exactly the Zelda game I've been waiting for., neg,1
Just watch out for lightning., neg,1
I've just won a tense trial by combat in a strange shrine overlooking the sea against a robotic Guardian., neg,0.6
The shrine sits on the brink of a high precipice., neg,1
I saw it from a distance and fought my way there; just because I could., neg,1
Now I'm trudging up a narrow ravine; following an ox I've startled; when suddenly a bokoblin on a horse wielding a spear comes charging over the rim toward me., neg,1
Startled; I draw my bow and take a shot; miss and he's upon me., pos,1
I whip out my blade and knock the monster from his mount; making short work of my opponent before hopping onto his horse and riding out onto the field on the other side; where another mounted bokoblin waits., neg,1
I switch weapons to a spear---longer reach works better on horseback---and a joust ensues., neg,1
Soon after; wide grassy plains give way to a rainswept jungle., pos,1
I explore; aimless and in no hurry to get anywhere; surrounded by high palms., neg,1
Waterfalls cascade all around., neg,1
Bananas hang from low branches., neg,1
Then suddenly; emerging from one of the myriad pools around me is a vast dragon; so long that by the time its head plunges into a distant lake; its tail is only just emerging from the pond., pos,1
I leap off a high ledge and paraglide down; glimpsing a distant stable below., neg,0.8
Here I land and begin conversing with the locals; who tell me stories of the surrounding area; dropping little hints and clues about where I might want to go next., neg,1
Maybe I'll follow those; or maybe I'll just., neg,1
do something else., neg,1
You can go anywhere and do anything in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild., neg,1
You might not be ready for what you find; but there's nothing stopping you from trying., neg,1
You might discover along the way that you need better provisions---outfits that ward against heat or cold; for instance; or potions and meals that do the same., neg,1
Some powers you find later into the game may help you traverse the world more easily or quickly; but after the game's opening segment; there's nothing gating you off from exploring every last inch of the massive world spread out before you., neg,1
That distant shrine overlooking the sea?, pos,1
Go there., neg,1
The only question is how best to make your journey., pos,0.6
That lava-spewing volcano in the distance?, neg,1
Better dress appropriately; or at least find some fire elixirs., neg,1
Fortunately; if you talk to everyone and do the little tasks asked of you; you'll probably find a fire elixir or two along the way., neg,1
Or you can just make one yourself., neg,1
The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild isn't just the best Zelda game I've ever played., pos,1
It's one of the best video games I've ever played., neg,1
Period., neg,1
It's unflinchingly ambitious and tirelessly innovative; and yet it feels like the natural culmination of decades of game design experience rolled into one big; awe-inspiring experience., pos,1
That it borrows from so many other open-world games; from Far Cry to Skyrim doesn't change the fact: What Nintendo has done here is something incredibly special., neg,0.8
The entire world of Breath of the Wild is a carefully crafted; carefully designed open-world puzzle., pos,1
The shrines and dungeons that you encounter offer their own more distilled and focused puzzles; each with its own creative twist; but the world itself is not just open for openness' sake., pos,1
You don't simply trudge across big open spaces., pos,1
Everywhere you go there's something to explore; some incredible discovery to make., pos,1
There's a story here; of course; which you uncover as you play in a totally open-ended; non-linear fashion., pos,1
But the backdrop to that story is your own adventure; and Nintendo uses organic; emergent storytelling in one of the most effective ways I've ever seen in a game., pos,0.8
The stories you tell your friends about this game will be your own; unique and fascinating and sometimes funny; too., pos,1
There's the time I found a massive ogre of some sort sleeping in a bog; and left him alone for fear he'd crush me., neg,1
Later; I found another one; far below a giant hole in the ground and avoided him; too., neg,1
Then I let my son play for a few minutes and he stumbled across a third., neg,1
The massive beast was sleeping atop a huge mound; surrounded by smaller minions., pos,1
It took me a few harrowing tries; but I finally brought the monster down and took his treasure; which was half-buried in the dirt., pos,1
Or the many times I solved ridiculously challenging Shrine puzzles thanks to a moment of genius (or happy accident!, pos,1
) or clever suggestion from my 6-year-old., pos,1
Or the time my stubborn; ornery horse walked us right off a cliff., neg,1
Sometimes; the best moments in Breath of the Wild are simply when you reach the top of some high peak after just barely clambering your way up and look around; amazed to know that everything you see laid out around you can be reached., pos,0.8
Then you hop into the air and glide in one direction or another., neg,1
It doesn't really matter which way you go; something will be there waiting to be discovered., neg,1
Oh and look; a falling star., neg,1
Let's go see where it landed., neg,1
The first time I was struck by lightning in Breath of the Wild; I didn't realize that it was because I had metal items equipped., neg,0.6
Before it struck me; I watched as lightning smashed into the landscape around me; grass and trees igniting into gouts of flame., neg,0.8
Rain makes walls too slick to climb., neg,1
One tower I climbed up was so high; it was freezing up top and I had to either drink a potion to keep me warm or leap off and move on., pos,1
These experiences constantly confront and astound throughout the game; and you find yourself falling into a rhythm that's almost hard to describe., neg,1
In spite of whatever influences Breath of the Wild wears on its sleeve; there's truly no other game like it., neg,1
The cycle continues in Breath of the Wild., neg,1
You play as the ancient hero Link; out on a quest to stop Calamity Ganon and rescue the Princess Zelda., pos,1
Only this time around; you aren't immediately stuck in a long tutorial., neg,1
The world isn't gated off in innumerable ways., neg,1
You begin on a Great Plateau where you learn that you've been asleep for 100 years., neg,1
A strange old man helps you fill your Sheikah Slate with the tools you need to accomplish your quest: two recharging bombs (one round and one cube); a magentic power; a time/motion stopping stasis power and a power that lets you change water into ice., pos,1
These powers; along with your ability to climb; swing blades and shoot a bow and arrow will be just about everything you need to solve every puzzle; navigate every dungeon; and travel to any point on the vast map ahead of you., neg,0.8
Many other tools; items; weapons and so forth will aid you along your way; but these basics are all you need., neg,1
Then you set out; journeying whichever direction you please; uncovering secrets along the way; meeting strangers on the road and at stables and villages; slowly unlocking the mystery of your past and Zelda's story; and moving ever closer to your quest., pos,1
Depending on which way you set out in the beginning of the game; your quest and mine may play out in wholly different ways., pos,1
No other open-world game; including a masterpiece like The Witcher 3; has been so free-roaming and organic; let alone as carefully designed and hand-crafted., neg,1
You have a stamina wheel that depletes when climbing; running or gliding; and the normal hearts that serve as hit points., neg,1
There's also a hot/cold meter that warns if you're reaching unsustainable temperatures., neg,1
Various other special powers and systems come into play as you progress in the game; though I won't spoil any of them., neg,1
There's a way to expand inventory; too; which is nice and offers up its own set of mini-puzzles., pos,0.8
Link has a variety of weapons at his disposal; and you constantly find new swords; axes; spears; bows and shields; all with their own power rating; durability and some with special powers like fire or lightning., neg,1
You'll also find various outfits (or buy them from merchants) that can do different things; some with incredible powers that help you progress further in the game., pos,1
You can boost stats on these if you find the right NPCs; and you can dye them; adding some basic aesthetic customization to the game., neg,0.6
One of my biggest complaints about open-world games is that they almost always sacrifice a sense of mission design in favor of generic openness., neg,1
That is not the case here., neg,1
I've never played an open world game like this before; as though countless levels have been seamlessly woven together., pos,1
Perhaps the closest thing is Dark Souls; though it is less strictly open-world., pos,0.8
Both games buck the trend of openness for its own sake; though Souls gates off areas until you progress to a certain point., pos,0.8
Really; the original Dark Souls was the last time I felt so in awe of a video game., neg,1
Breath of the Wild stands shoulder to shoulder with that game as a modern masterpiece of game design and both sit in the pantheon of my all-time favorite games., pos,0.8
I'm done gushing for a little while., neg,1
Despite being a modern-day video game masterpiece; Breath of the Wild is not without its flaws., pos,1
These are all issues that I've had with the game; but none of them are particularly distracting and none really detracts from the overall experience., neg,1
Picking up items and plants and what-not is very quick; for instance., neg,1
You don't have to kneel down and harvest stuff like in many other games., neg,1
You just press a button and it goes into your inventory., neg,1
Weapons break; but nearly every enemy drops one when they go down., neg,1
Really; the only actual thing that I find disappointing about the game is the frame-rate issues; and that; I think; really speaks to Nintendo's decision making on the Switch side., neg,1
I love the new console; but there's no denying it could be a little more powerful., pos,1
Certainly a huge; complex game like Breath of the Wild could make great use of a stronger system., pos,1
On the other hand; it's quite wonderful to be able to play the game on the go; utilizing the Switch's handheld mode., pos,1
The game looks fantastic on the Switch's tablet screen; and it's just amazing to be able to play it on the TV and then pop it out and take it with you anywhere you please., pos,1
I give the game a resounding Buy on my Buy/Hold/Sell scale., pos,1
It's one of the best video games I've ever played; and is sure to keep you busy for many hours; days and weeks; exploring this vast; beautiful; unexpected world., pos,1
I can't speak to the Wii U version; but I'm sure either version will delight and inspire., pos,1
Don't miss this one; even if you're not a fan of older Zelda games., neg,1
New fans and old fans alike will find so much to love in this game., neg,1
In a lot of ways; it's really just a game you have to experience for yourself., neg,1
I'll have a lot more to say about Breath of the Wild; as well as some videos to post on my YouTube channel and here; so stay tuned., neg,1
I really can't wait for all of you to play it; and for us to trade stories., neg,1
Thanks; as always; for reading., neg,1
TL;DR: The new Zelda is one of the best games I've ever played., pos,1
Period., neg,1
Do yourself a favor and experience it for yourself., neg,1
At this point; the Legend of Zelda series operates on a rhythm so predictable you can practically set your watch to it., neg,1
In a Zelda game; after an extremely slow-paced tutorial; you progress from puzzle-filled dungeon to puzzle-filled dungeon; finding in each one a key item that--coincidentally--is crucial to beating the dungeon boss and to finding the next dungeon., pos,1
Between dungeons; you face perfunctory battles with simple enemies on a vast overworld map dotted with small towns and occasional mini-games and side-quests., neg,1
Most of these give you rewards that are already so plentiful as to be practically worthless (oh; goodie; more rupees to fill my already full wallet)., neg,0.8
By the time you reach Ganon; your circuitous trip from point A to point B has given you a set of required powers that help you take on the big bad boss threatening the kingdom., neg,1
Individual Zelda games each make slight variations to this formula; but the basic rhythm is there every time., neg,1
And then there's the new Breath of the Wild (BotW); a Zelda game that throws off this established rhythm so quickly; and with such force; that it practically feels like a whole new genre., neg,1
In doing so; Breath of the Wild offers a compelling take on a stagnating series; bringing a sense of wonder and excitement back to Zelda that hasn't been felt this strongly since the original NES game., pos,1
The one area where Breath of the Wild doesn't deviate much from previous Zelda games is in the extremely generic fantasy plotting., neg,1
Link; the mystical guardian of Hyrule; has been awakened without memories from a 100-year slumber in order to find the previously peaceful Hyrule ravaged by the dark power of Ganon and his minions., neg,0.8
The few survivors in this dark world huddle together in small villages; separated by vast plains and mountains crawling with monsters., neg,0.8
It's up to you to traverse this massive world; regaining control of four giant; corrupted stone machines (called Divine Beasts in an odd bit of translation) that can help weaken Ganon and free Hyrule once and for all., neg,1
What the plot lacks in surprise or originality; it makes up for in entertaining and broadly written characters; divided into a few distinctly socialized species., neg,0.6
In addition to Link's fellow Hylians; you run into the wary-yet-imploring fish-like Zora; the coolly strong; Amazonian female fighters of the Gerudo; the arrogant; bird-like Rito; and the jovial; rotund; and rock-loving Goron., pos,0.6
In each society; you recruit the aid of a 100-year-old spirit who helps Link slowly unlock the memories of his past as Hyrule's protector., neg,1
All of the characters you meet are rendered with over-the-top facial expressions and cheesy; heartfelt dialogue that effectively conveys broad character quirks with just a few words., neg,1
BotW even infuses its most throwaway characters with cute; clever traits and often goofy backstories that will stick with you., neg,0.6
The titular Princess Zelda; far from being a mere damsel in distress; appears here as a hard-working royal fighting for her kingdom., neg,1
She's trapped in the castle; desperately using her powers to contain Ganon's damage; but you eventually learn about a younger Zelda--a cautious; careful researcher; working herself to the bone to develop her powers and save the world., pos,0.8
Her apparent frustration with the challenge and her quiet resolve to succeed make this one of the series' most compelling Zeldas yet., pos,1
Zelda fans may be shocked at just how quickly Breath of the Wild throws special powers at its hero., neg,1
After just a few hours in the gentle starting area (with a minimum of pop-up tutorial messages; thankfully); the game provides you with easily 80 percent of the key items and powers needed to progress in the game., pos,1
These include an endless supply of remote-detonating bombs; handy magnetic magic that can move metal obstacles (or drop metal boxes on opposing enemies); a handheld glider that lets you float down from high peaks (and across vast valleys); and a time-freezing ability that stops moving obstacles and knocks them out of the way., pos,0.8
In previous Zelda games; each of these abilities would get its own lengthy dungeon; spaced out through the game to slowly teach you all you need to know., neg,1
Here; the abilities are handed out quickly through five-minute puzzle shrines; after which the game trusts you to figure out when and where to mix and match your new powers., neg,0.8
Still; having so many powers so quickly doesn't make you feel dominant--Breath of the Wild constantly feels like a fight for survival., neg,0.6
Enemies that you encounter; far from being the perfunctory fodder of older Zelda games; are tough and lethal; never hesitating to join together in groups and attack Link en masse., neg,1
Strikes on both sides feel impactful; especially when Link or his foes get knocked over and roll end over end; rag-doll style; across the ground or over cliffs., neg,1
Right from the start; many enemies can kill an under-equipped Link with a single strike if he isn't careful., neg,1
I'd compare the fights to those in the Dark Souls series; except that Breath of the Wild's battles feel more fast-paced and responsive than the plodding dodge-and-strike festivals that can characterize those games., neg,1
There's not a huge variety to the enemies--you'll see the same basic types with only minor variations over and over., pos,1
Each one is beautifully animated; though; from unsophisticated; street-tough Moblins to skittering; human-sized lizards to slow; lumbering giants that frequently miss kicks over Link's head., pos,1
The enemies seem imbued with a sense of life; not just as they retreat and re-engage during battle but also as they sit all alone in the wild., neg,1
Sneaking up on an enemy camp; you can often find monsters congregating around campfires in makeshift treetop bases or cave-dwellings., neg,1
You'll see them dancing; sleeping; eating; and fighting each other even before you sneak up; and you'll often discover interesting detritus from their own living conditions after a battle is over., neg,1
You can work your way around many enemy encounters if you want; but it's not a great long-term strategy., pos,1
Eventually; you'll be glad you faced down a tough group of monsters in order to pick up the powerful weapons they drop; which make the next battle that much easier., neg,1
You can't rely on a single overpowered weapon for long; though; because even the sturdiest of weapons will break in your hands after just a few dozen battles (the same is true of shields and bows; which need to be constantly replaced due to wear and tear)., neg,1
This forces you to continually pick up new weapons dropped by newer and more difficult enemies or found in hidden nooks and crannies around the massive world., pos,0.6
You'll have to learn the different rhythms of each weapon type; as well., pos,1
Battling with a powerful but slow two-handed broadsword feels very different from the quick bashing of a one-handed club; the long range poking of a trident; or a tri-tipped boomerang that doubles as a quick and effective sword., pos,1
Success requires a constant balancing act between using the most effective weapon for the situation and saving your powerful hardware for the tougher enemies you know are coming., pos,1
It's also a welcome change from most Zelda games; where weaponry advancement practically begins and ends with the Master Sword., pos,1
The scrounging for survival extends to the hundreds of basic materials that you can pick up around the world; everything from apples and acorns to rare minerals; flowers; and even monster body parts., pos,1
Many of these are useful on their own; but they're much more effective after being cooked at a fire with improvised recipes that unlock their true potential., neg,1
You can easily stockpile these cooked dishes; using their health-restoring and power-up properties to brute-force your way through some of the game's toughest areas and battles., pos,1
That's a nice concession to gamers who might balk at the higher-than-normal Zelda difficulty of even basic battles and also a nice reward for those willing to take the time to forage., pos,1
Even the basic currency that's so prevalent in most Zelda games is relatively rare in Breath of the Wild., pos,1
Instead of stumbling upon piles of loose rupees; you often have to consider whether to sell precious minerals and rare items to afford that shiny; extremely useful suit of protective armor., pos,0.8
Items like arrows are also in relatively short supply compared to previous Zelda games that seemed to force them on players., neg,1
Between the tough enemies; the fragile weapons; and the constant search for cooking materials and other items; exploring and battling in Breath of the Wild feels like an important struggle for resources; rather than a perfunctory search for the few meaningful items amid a sea of useless drivel., neg,1
It's an addictive cycle that urges you to keep working to replenish your constantly dwindling supplies., pos,1
More than any Zelda game before; Breath of the Wild makes good use of its 3D verticality., neg,0.6
Link can climb up almost any rocky wall in the game; limited only by a stamina gauge that declines as he climbs and replenishes when he's standing on solid ground., neg,0.6
(Stamina also limits your swimming distance and the amount of continuous running you can do)., neg,1
Increasing the size of this gauge (by finding short; puzzle-filled shrines hidden about the world) makes it easier to scale the tallest peaks; giving you a good vantage point to see far-off goals that might not even be on your map yet., neg,1
Getting high up also provides a good launching point for Link to glide across long sections of treacherous terrain; which can be a much more efficient way to travel than slowly running across barren plains or finding a bridge over empty chasms., neg,1
Clever climbing and swimming; in conjunction with some stamina-improving foods and elixirs; can sometimes let Link work his way around apparent threats or into massive shortcuts down the intended path to a certain goal., neg,1
That can put Link into situations the game obviously didn't expect him to reach until he was more powerful., pos,1
While a few sections of the map are gated behind specific items or abilities; for the most part you really can tackle any part of the game in any order you want; as long as you're willing to scrounge for the weapons and items you'll need to survive the harshest challenges (or face them as an underpowered scrub--speedruns of this game are going to be incredible., pos,1
